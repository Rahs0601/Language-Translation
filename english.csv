Please turn down the music.
I'm engaged.

He's gone into hiding.
Everyone looks confused.
I have to stop.
I'll tell you afterwards.
Drive slowly.
I thought I was too young.
He went to stay with his cousin.
I want to stay.
I think that I'm just exhausted.
Don't you have work today?
"Sure, it might be traumatic, but so what?"
He refused to take the bribe.
We are moving next month.
It's the least I could do.
He prided himself on his punctuality.
I'm just worried about my weight.
He was accused falsely.
If I'd only taken your advice!
I'd say you did well.
You stick out like a sore thumb.
Two tears fell down her cheeks.
Stay away from him!
Where is your house?

You are going to have to pay for it.
I'll tell Tom what a great job you did.
He is able to speak ten languages.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.

Have a seat.
I'm trying to remember.
He worked through the night.
I gave him my address.
Were you with anyone?
I really am glad you're here.
The greatest happiness lies in freedom.
It's no use pretending that you can't speak French.
It was long.
Tom lost his house keys.
Please feel free to ask me questions.
I must hide.
Try to calm down.
Nobody cares what you think.
He stood behind his mother.
Is he breathing?
I ate my sandwich.
They are all alike.
We have a mutual friend.
This is not a coincidence.
I'll give you a ride.
She advised him to work harder.
He felt nervous about the result.
Tom slept outside.
"Be quiet. If you aren't quiet, you'll be thrown out."
You are big.
Have you already eaten supper?
Do it right away.
"I have time, so I'll do it."
Are you sure you're up for it?
Everyone hesitated.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
You've already forgotten.
I'd like to buy this computer.
I know all about you.

I go to the beach almost every day.
He was unaware of the danger.
I am worried about my mother's health.
She was born lucky.
Tom is wearing the sunglasses he bought yesterday.
I sometimes dream of my mother.
It wasn't a request.
Did you already do your homework?
I was able to swim across the river.
"Right now, all I want to do is sleep for a few hours."
Are you laughing at me?
I don't know what to sing.
Some people believe that black cats bring bad luck.
Can you come?
It looks like he might win first prize.
Tom couldn't find his shoes.
You all right?
What mileage do you get with this car?
It's a little bit dangerous.
I'm looking forward to receiving your reply.
You killed my mother.
What was the time of death?
Don't you read the tabloids?
Forget I said anything.
I've done it.
Can you make yourself understood in French?
Everything went as planned.
It might just be a coincidence.
Give me a hammer.
We can't go back there.
I'm going to save more money.
He smiled and left.
What don't you want me to do?
Shut the door.
Father is having a bath.
She can speak French.
Take a walk.
I slept very well last night.
She's a professional photographer.
Stay close.
I have no idea how many people will be at the picnic.
He was given the sack.
My father does not like music.
I have no desire to hurt you.
I prefer not to talk about it.
I'm sick of this war.
I told you this is where we'd find Tom.
Is that thing working?
We happened to meet at the station.
You're so impatient.
You have to speak English.
I dream of seeing him there.
He predicted she would win.
It's unlikely that our team will win.
I wish she had come last night.
He doesn't know how to write a letter in English.
I am married and I have two sons.
I'd be depressed if they asked me to quit the team.
You are entitled to try once again.
He gave an angry shake of his head.
She is graceful.
Nothing is more pleasant than traveling.
Isn't it the other way around?
This plane flies between Osaka and Hakodate.
Will you ever forgive me?
He's as strong as a horse.
He asked me to wake him at six.
He is taller than any other boy in his class.
The police covered the body with a sheet.
No one is thrilled.
Do you have a bag?
Don't look at me with such sad eyes.
That wasn't part of the plan.
I have a sore throat and a fever.
"If the phone rings again, I will ignore it."
She called him to say that she'd be late.
I'm thorough.
"You were there, too."
I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth.
He will arrive there about five o'clock.
Be confident.
I'll see to it.
I can't go with you.
How much does the job pay?
This list is not official.
They stayed friends.
Could you please kiss a little bit more slowly?
What did I just say?
What do you see in him?
Can you please stop singing?
What do you learn English for?
Don't you know who that is?
You can't judge people by their looks.
He hurt himself during yesterday's game.
All aboard!
He doesn't allow interruptions.
You are watching TV all the time.
We study French.
I've got to do this.
You're very stylish.
When did you find out?
I can't talk about that.
Do you want to go get a drink?
I felt relieved when my plane landed safely.
You reap what you sow.
It's a girl thing.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Tom disappeared.
He pasted the notice on the door.
Shut the door.
Tom doesn't earn enough money to support a family.
"Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come."
I'm really surprised you got a prize.
He's hopelessly in love.
Mary did it for free.
We had many bitter experiences during the war.
Mine is totally different.
The policeman grabbed the robber's arm.
She shrieked.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
"If you want to stay here, you are welcome to."
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
It'll cost at least five dollars.
She looked away.
They made the goal.
This is a free ticket.
I wish I earned more money.
I'm all alone.
Tom doesn't help me.
The water was warm.
I'm pleased with my new jacket.
I never thought it would be so exciting.
What are you going to be when you grow up?
I convinced Tom that he should go to Boston with Mary.
I'm smarter than you.
Anything could happen.
I was happy to see him.
Don't judge people by their appearance.
He had no choice but to run away.
He is anxious to go to America.
I know what you were doing.
You can rely on me.
A bat flying in the sky looks like a butterfly.
"She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it."
We're contented.
You're too polite.
How did you get here so fast?
He resembles his father very much.
I get motion sickness.
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
You'd be perfect for that.
I thought you would come.
A squirrel hid among the branches.
Please take a bath.
Lunch is ready.
I did it all by myself.
This car cost me a fortune.
The schoolboys teased each other endlessly.
I think you must be getting tired.
"Could I speak to you for a moment, Tom?"
I don't have enough money to buy a new bicycle.
Does this have to be done now?
Almost no one thinks that we are sisters.
This is bad news.
She writes to me once a month.
Cancer can be cured if discovered in time.
I came with my friends.
I have only just begun.
Tom forgot his glasses.
No one wanted to babysit Tom.
I have enough money to buy it.
Don't be crude.
Come and get it.
Why were you fired?
Things have been pretty tough lately.
You need to be more patient.
I figured I'd be safe here.
They clung together for warmth.
Tom said everything he wanted to say.
Can we have a moment alone?
I don't know if he's a doctor.
He decided to put off his departure.
There is a rock in my shoe.
I gave it away.
Did you buy a return ticket?
I appreciate this so much.
The storm prevented us from going out.
Whose son are you?
I'll look after your child while you are away.
I forgot to tell you my phone number.
There's the rub.
I married off my daughter.
You're almost right.
I don't like this idea.
Is anyone on board?
The man robbed him of all his money.
He left the water running.
Why wasn't I informed earlier?
It's now or never.
I don't feel sorry for you.
I'm going to be your teacher.
Don't try this at home.
They knew how much danger they were in.
He is watching TV.
I don't know if we're going to be able to do that.
Your cat is fat.
What is this fish called in English?
I stayed longer than I thought I would.
I think it's OK.
I can't believe you just said that.
I shouldn't have done that.
I was still eating when the doorbell rang.
That's very thoughtful.
She doesn't live with him.
We're not family.
What're you doing today?
Your effort will be rewarded in the long run.
Let's do that together.
Good luck to both of you.
The water pipe burst.
They are still children.
The post office is just past the bank.
I saw her last week.
Would you ever go out with a guy who couldn't sing?
"I'm sorry, but he isn't home."
She didn't telephone after all.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
You must do it quickly.
Do you even care?
Tom is here to protect me.
We have a holiday today.
My mom likes my brother more than me.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
He gave body and soul to his job.
I already told you that a hundred times.
Please choose wisely.
Remember what Tom told us.
I'm glad I invited you.
All you have to do is write it down.
Don't say anything unless it's important.
Are they all nuts?
Women feel that men are often very complicated.
She wrote to him to tell him how wonderful he was.
I couldn't do that either.
The door was locked from within.
You're out of touch with reality.
I've been shopping all day.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to go.
I am not proud of this.
I can't get you out of my head.
Some children are swimming in the river.
Did you have a favorite book as a child?
Eat a lot of vegetables.
There's no one left.
I know what it's like to be the new guy.
This doesn't change anything.
Stay in this room.
He was busy yesterday afternoon.
Tom has a very large ego.
It's too early to get up.
This room is for rent.
I really like French cooking.
There were only six people at the meeting.
That sounds interesting.
There were a lot of young couples in the park.
I can't remember how to spell her name.
My dog eats just about anything.
I came early in order to get a good seat.
You think you're funny?
"If you want to, we'll go."
"If I had my way, you would all be fired."
I've got plenty of room.
You look like a little girl in that dress.
Marimbas are made from rosewood.
I got it for Christmas.
No one can tell.
The fireman could not extinguish the flames.
I'm really fed up with this heat.
He wants an apple.
Get your gear.
You look just like your father.
A trip to the Riviera should do you good.
He wanted to know more about the flowers.
He comes into contact with all kinds of people.
What do you want?
I usually eat lunch at 11:30 to avoid the rush.
"I could be wrong, but I think Tom likes you."
"In case of emergency, call the police."
"The more money we have, the more we want."
I'm coming to help you.
I'm surprised they didn't have anything to do.
You get out only what you put in.
I want to thank you.
She greeted him cheerfully.
I don't think it's my decision alone.
Life is full of surprises.
That's unimportant.
I daydreamed all day.
I have a problem dealing with authority.
This lid is so tight I can't open it.
I know this must be hard for you.
Tom's safe.
Tom washes his car at least once a week.
"May I have your name and telephone number, please?"
They were so happy together.
You don't have to answer this question.
He grabbed my arm.
Don't push me.
I feel the same way as you do.
Tom went back into his office.
I think my German is really bad.
I was grateful.
I thought you were older than me.
I like to be here.
I just want to hear your reasons.
I've made the same mistakes as I made last time.
It is not easy to get rid of a bad habit.
She helps us.
You'll never be alone.
Quit acting like a baby.
Where are they taking you?
Who's your favorite lyricist?
I messed up.
I think you should get it.
One of them is a spy.
You can't trust anything he says.
He hung a picture on the wall.
I bought an old lamp.
I live nearby.
Tom tells me you're his assistant.
"Because I was in a hurry, I had to take a taxi."
You want this?
Everything is now ready for you.
I think I lost my keys.
Tom doesn't believe a word of what Mary just said.
She divorced him last year.
I'll do anything you wish.
He picked it up carefully.
They're not following.
It never snows here.
Am I on that list?
Why did you take a cab?
I remember seeing this before.
Where are you heading?
Are you heading somewhere?
This window is bulletproof.
"Next time, you won't be so lucky."
Carrots are good for the eyesight.
He's not the brightest guy in the world.
Why don't you pull over?
I hope Tom is right.
I don't want you to be upset.
I never see you without thinking of my father.
I took the cake out of the oven.
I saw a spider walking on the ceiling.
She spoke to me with a smile.
Tom is hoping you'll do it.
Tom has lived in Boston for three years.
They did it in front of the staff.
Tom is taller than his mother.
Did you find your keys?
I was eventually released.
They said you were fired.
I brought one just in case.
I'd like to ask you about how to do that.
You abandoned me.
Don't tell your mother.
The cause of the fire is not known.
Do as I tell you.
Most elevators operate automatically.
I got bored.
Do you really want to get more done?
He appeared young.
You're really selfish.
Is this guy bothering you?
The main valve is turned off.
What was it that he was looking for?
She must go there.
I hope you two are very happy.
I didn't think you would come.
Is there something you want to ask?
Tom is on the go day and night.
"You didn't come here alone, did you?"
Maybe I deserve this.
We've accomplished a lot of things.
I don't have time to do the laundry.
Ask her for advice.
I will never forget this.
Tom has a soft spot for Mary.
Don't be mean.
It's not far to Boston.
Do you remember what you did last Friday?
I have no will power when it comes to dieting.
That was a total waste of time.
We were passengers.
You are not a doctor.
Tom really does talk a lot.
They stated their objections.
Fear washed across the stock market.
A dog was running.
I don't sleep anymore.
Tom knew all that.
Who helps your mother?
I don't know what you're looking for.
I messed up.
He got the job.
Roulette is a game of chance.
Did I mention that?
I'm not really worried.
He came to pick me up.
She took part in the contest.
His dream came true.
Tom looks like his mother.
Give me a second.
Can't you speak French?
He walked along the shore.
She has snow-white skin.
What are you trying to prove?
The game became exciting.
That's absolute nonsense!
He's too old for you.
Just tell us the truth.
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
You must pay in advance.
How's your wife?
"If I had wings to fly, I would have gone to save her."
You're not the only one that was hurt.
I'll be fine.
I saw you outside.
The tree blocked the road.
Come on!
You're really gifted.
I was miserable without you.
I only have American coins in my pocket right now.
He made me out to be a liar.
He taught me how to swim.
I can't give up.
What are you doing today?
What are you good at?
I don't do this for the money.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Do you have plans for dinner?
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
I forgot to lock the door.
I wish I could live in a house that nice.
What's done is done.
She invited us to her birthday party.
He took me for everything I had.
When does the show start?
This clock loses three minutes a day.
I opened an account at a nearby bank.
We're all devastated.
You can't unscramble an egg.
I need more gold.
I'd like to know a little bit more about you.
I read the book from cover to cover.
Accidents are inevitable.
I'll need you to be there.
"I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never came."
I hope you're wrong.
I like astrology.
He has a very expensive watch.
"Bring me today's paper, please."
I'm tired of arguing.
I'm 24 years old.
Why don't we go together?
He was slain in battle.
I don't think I can do it.
Let's not wait for the others.
Are you free this afternoon?
Are you ambitious?
I know some of Tom's friends.
I think Tom really deserves it.
She kept on talking while eating.
Please put that on the table.
My watch is five minutes slow.
Tom is complaining to the manager.
Tom was a model inmate.
The robber was nabbed this morning.
The work is practically finished.
Tom teaches French in Boston.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
Whatever he says goes.
He always gets home at six o'clock in the evening.
I run every day.
He is much taller than I am.
I am harvesting wheat.
There are too many things to do!
This is a fantastic place.
I think nobody's home.
Is there hot water?
"If I had known it, I would have told you."
Would you like to switch seats?
I want that.
What exactly don't you get?
I don't usually eat red meat.
Tom smokes.
We've been busy.
Let's split the reward fifty-fifty.
Show it to her.
She's got a point.
I'm stuck in my job.
I am delighted to be here.
She advised him to stop drinking.
I don't know where that came from.
I have enough money to buy it.
I'm so unlucky!
The car didn't move.
This information checks out all right.
My mother was an alcoholic.
I've got a sweet tooth.
Everyone is going.
You look nervous.
Let's not gloat.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Are you close to your family?
Would you mind if I took a break?
He is equal to the job.
I fed the leftovers to my dog.
You're no fun.
Have you spoken to Tom?
I had no chance to relax there.
He did a pretty good job.
You can't reason with Tom.
English is spoken in many parts of the world.
I need to warn my mom.
Why do you want that anyway?
Is that what you wanted to talk about?
Isn't that what you were hoping for?
"If it rains tomorrow, I'm not going to the meeting."
I didn't mean to make him cry.
She looked him straight in the eyes.
I won't forget.
The conference will end tomorrow.
How much do you want?
Tom has a lot of responsibilities.
I thought a person like you would understand.
He married his daughter to a lawyer.
What happened in here?
Is this price acceptable?
You've got the map upside down.
Everyone needs to do this.
He's intimidated by beautiful women.
Somebody is eating.
They were very kind to me.
How many are there in your class?
They're amazing.
It's all our fault.
What a pleasant surprise!
That bicycle over there is my brother's.
Does it snow a lot in the winter?
This just isn't like you.
I wish I had more friends.
I need to wash my hands.
Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Have you finished it?
Cherry blossoms are very beautiful.
Tom tried to resuscitate Mary.
He felt ill at ease.
She wouldn't give him the time of day.
Can you read what that says?
Put your hands up in the air!
I've found a good job.
Are you here to spy on me?
I require your assistance.
I'll miss this place once I leave.
It was too muggy for me to get to sleep last night.
What time does the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
All of my students call me by my first name.
Of course.
I never said you were boring.
There's a long line at every cash register.
Tom doesn't like to be contradicted.
He slipped on a banana peel.
"Frankly speaking, I hate him."
I don't want to hear anything more about that.
It just makes no sense.
How can we let this happen?
I have a lot of friends to help me.
Tom needed your help.
I'll stand.
You have a lot of nerve!
Where's convenient for you?
Cookie's mother died of cancer.
I think we should go now.
Tom struggled to climb to the top.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Last month he had his house painted white.
I didn't hear it.
This tea is too bitter.
Tom is never on time.
You need a lot of water.
Show me the way to the bus stop.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
He was named after his grandfather.
They held hands.
What would cause this?
You don't talk a lot.
He kindly answered the question.
What time will you have breakfast?
I think you're going to enjoy spending time with Tom.
Stop being so nice to me.
I realized what was happening.
You're so impatient.
Does that mean you bought it?
We've seen her.
You are a good student.
They relaxed.
I'm glad I make you happy.
You can't handle this alone.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
You don't have to trouble yourselves.
I will quit smoking for good.
Why do you want to die?
He hesitated before answering.
How many books are there on the table?
I approve of your plan.
"You can't see me, can you?"
Pleased to meet you.
You don't need me anymore.
Is it time you need?
He blew the deal.
I was really upset.
Tom's arm must be amputated.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
It's inadequate.
She was on the verge of crying.
I can't use that.
I disagree with you on this.
I almost forgot all about that.
He had no money.
We flew across the Atlantic.
His bicycle is blue.
There is no way of knowing where he's gone.
Will it take long to recover?
Death before dishonor!
That only makes the problem worse.
How would you translate this sentence?
I haven't read today's newspaper yet.
He's a freshman.
I like things just the way they are.
The man must be insane.
"Sorry, I couldn't help it."
I want you to be my manager.
Preheat the oven to 130 degrees.
I only have a few books.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
Would you mind sharing your table?
You've never told me that before.
I really misjudged you.
There is a TV remote control under the couch.
This movie is really scary.
This watch is better than that one.
I detest hypocrisy.
You can help.
We walked among the trees.
Tom wants a beer.
You've got to move.
I thought you were broke.
I can't stand his arrogance.
You gotta get more organized.
This is the most comfortable chair in our house.
I'm stubborn.
I feel good after exercising.
I had to get some money.
How many brothers do you have?
The cat is black.
No one is listening to me.
We plan on staying a week.
They formed a new government.
I want you to give up this stupid plan.
Tom can't swim as fast as Mary.
It's to your left.
I hate being stupid.
That made me laugh.
Never do anything just to show you can.
I don't like studying in this heat.
I refuse to obey you any longer.
We don't even know if it's true.
You need to pay extra for the batteries.
I have a cold.
I'd like to speak with you.
I guess you know I've missed you.
I'm shooting.
I didn't sign up for this.
It is two o'clock in the morning.
You must have forgotten them at the office.
We're still alive.
"To drive a car, you need a license."
One is red and the other is white.
It cost him ten dollars to get the ticket.
The prisoners were set free.
I don't feel like eating anything.
You should face up to the reality.
Am I under suspicion here?
Tom doesn't drink beer at home.
Do you want to go in?
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
Why is my sister so mean?
The news made her happy.
I don't watch TV.
I want to be more than friends.
He's kind of cute.
I'm visiting a friend of mine in the hospital.
Please be serious.
I heard my phone ring.
I truly apologize.
We voted against the bill.
You're very sophisticated.
You should ask Tom for advice.
That's what I was thinking.
It's a cloak-and-dagger operation.
They will survive.
The prisoners have been released.
She was a medical student.
A rack of lamb makes a great meal.
"Somehow, he weaseled himself out of jury duty."
Could you tell me what's going on?
I think about Tom often.
My wife and I are expecting our first child.
I just had to see you guys before I left.
That's amazing!
I want some answers.
I looked in the window.
Tom treats me like an adult.
They do it faster than me.
What do you say we go for a swim?
Is she all right?
I love you the best of all.
I don't know where they are.
"This time, you've gone too far."
What did you do yesterday?
"You're not that old, Tom."
My sons are soldiers.
Why is my sister so mean to me?
You will soon get well.
Call us.
Don't you remember my name?
That cost him his job.
They're waiting for you.
You don't have the time.
The police accused him.
He sat next to her.
He called off the trip.
They were all scared.
Do you know where I live?
Kids are smarter than you think.
I want to talk with the manager about the schedule.
You're acting like a child.
We ran after the thief.
Today's special is fish.
We need to find somewhere to hide.
You'd be perfect for that.
I don't usually burn incense at home.
Be there tonight.
He encouraged me to try again.
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
Music is a universal language.
Tom and Mary went outside.
Are you prepared for the worst?
I feel really stupid.
Tom's arrived.
I want to make friends with your sister.
He was overwhelmed by the intensity of her love.
Let's have a look.
I'm at work.
I'm not going to sign this.
Tom said that Mary wasn't in a hurry.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
She's a beauty.
I don't belong to any club.
"I make you nervous, don't I?"
May I have a piece of it?
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Can you do it faster?
Tom runs fast.
I would be more careful if I were you.
Your ideas are always appreciated.
After you.
No problem.
She's a big teaser.
She's adorable.
I have to paint it.
I haven't finished my work.
I thought Tom was unemployed.
Why don't you stay and drink some wine with us?
Why bother fixing it?
That's funny.
I am a good boy.
I fell for it.
I don't care what happened.
You're surrounded.
It was terribly cold yesterday.
I would like to come and see you.
Drop me a line when you get there.
I didn't want you to make a fuss.
You need to be more careful.
He walked quietly.
Look up the phrase in your dictionary.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
Tell me about your plan.
You're always nagging me.
Don't open your book.
The shop was crowded with young people.
That sounds very interesting.
How much is the rent per month?
Where do you live?
Tom knew he was being watched.
Children don't like to take a bath.
I've never trusted him and I never will.
You live in my heart.
I find that very interesting.
It's a fad.
There's no mistake.
I've never seen a whale that big.
It's a proven fact.
The shirt that I've just bought is very nice.
I am afraid that he might get hurt.
I don't have any objection to that.
We need to do this report again.
You came too late.
Tell me you're kidding.
Our ammunition has run out.
How far do you live from here?
Honesty is the primary reason for his success.
That's the problem with doing things your way.
I just don't get it.
Did you have breakfast?
His father doesn't play golf.
There's no shortage of work around here.
I think I did well.
Boil some water.
How did you come by all this money?
This is one of the best schools in the country.
This is my mother's recipe.
I was devastated.
Tom will be back next week.
My older sister is good at typing.
Tom often comes to see me on weekends.
"Well, Tom, shouldn't we tell Mary?"
"No matter how hard he tried, my opinion didn't change."
I confessed my sin.
I'm sorry about last night.
He came here before noon.
"Mary wants kids, but Tom doesn't."
It's an investment.
A tall building was built next to my house.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Meet me in the lobby.
I can't allow you to do that.
I'm just waiting for a friend.
"Two beers, please."
I will go if you go.
The lights went out.
I think we should call the police.
I will always be with you.
I want to see him very much.
Are you sure this is the right train?
I'd buy that.
I think you panicked.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
I'll kick your butt!
I'm not your enemy.
It's here.
I accompanied her on a walk.
We're housesitting.
Tom is living in a small apartment on Park Street.
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
Do you find that washing machine easy to use?
Anyone over eighteen years of age counts as an adult.
You shouldn't have done that.
Where should I put my bags?
This book isn't worth reading.
This makes me curious.
He is away from home.
They were afraid of you.
Do you want us to call you?
Read what's on the label.
You were my friend.
Where did you go?
There was a food fight in the cafeteria.
There's a catch.
I don't know who he is.
Don't let your feelings show.
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my wife?
You should eat.
He is skating.
Do you have plans for dinner?
Remember not to tell anyone.
You never have any money.
Tom learned to dive when he was five.
I was lying on my back.
Do you want to go to the aquarium?
This is a wig.
Let's sit down and discuss it calmly.
Tom never said no.
What's taking you so long?
That's why I called you.
You may have that opportunity.
I went swimming after I woke up.
"You like cats, don't you?"
Were you hurt?
That's very kind of you to say that.
I am going to be fourteen.
Is it safe to drink this water?
Both of them said they would come.
It takes time to heal from a divorce.
Tom offered Mary his beer.
I'll go ahead.
From which station does the train leave?
I want to buy a new bicycle.
He asked for help.
Tom has to work tomorrow.
Be fair.
Hunger is the best sauce.
He will make a good doctor.
Don't ask so many questions.
The world economy is in recession now.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
They guaranteed regular employment to their workers.
I want to go to Mars.
Would you like me to go there with you?
I don't want to tell my parents.
I watch the news every evening.
I didn't realize the difference between them.
She is strong.
They received a box of books.
Don't you want to know why I did that?
I'm not writing about you.
Why does everybody love cats?
Did you have fun?
I never saw you.
They cannot be saved.
Let's begin with the first chapter.
No one ever comes here.
I'm sorry I said that.
Tell him to mind his own business.
I ate something that didn't agree with me.
We've known each other since we were kids.
We're so proud of you!
Why is she looking at me?
Where can one buy books?
I've never heard English spoken so quickly.
Which one is broken?
I'll always be here to help you.
"Open the door, please."
Tom is visually impaired.
"Ever since he arrived, everything has changed."
"She is, indeed, a lovely girl."
It is an advantage to be able to use a computer.
We're getting close.
Do you want to sit down?
That was painful to watch.
Take her to the OR.
You said you had a theory.
We will make up for the loss.
Do you have any plans for today?
We've got a little time to relax.
What are we afraid of?
That might be difficult.
You're not being rational.
That's the last straw!
I know Tom knows something.
"Since you're tired, you should rest."
I thought you should see this contract.
He quit smoking for the sake of his health.
Are you still sleepy?
I am not studying now.
I appreciate your trying to protect me.
I don't want this shirt.
Where do you want us to start looking?
Where was your father?
The room was filled with people.
Who's taking responsibility for this mess?
Any of you can do it.
I just want to be your friend.
We watched a new program on television.
How do I get in touch with you?
"OK, I think I got it."
Keep your hands where I can see them.
I can't understand this word.
Where did you park the car?
Is his story true?
I don't like my job.
I can't save you this time.
Use it or lose it.
Draw a line on your paper.
She's well known as a singer.
His prompt action prevented an epidemic.
Give me a reason to stay.
That's a complex question.
Tom talked to a lot of people.
I'd be delighted.
Who wants it?
Tom forgot the key in the lock.
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
What exactly is your book about?
The audience gave Tom a standing ovation.
I used to work in an electronics store.
Is it damaged?
I can't bear the pain anymore.
Wait. I can't walk that fast.
I want to make something clear.
We have seen three wars.
We still have some work to do.
Thank you for your kind words.
That shop has many customers.
You get out only what you put in.
I knew you would do something great.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Do you know where it is?
Stay out of my kitchen.
"He did it not once, but twice."
Would you like to see your room?
It's a good start.
I'm saving this seat for Tom.
You really shouldn't use pirated software.
This road is terrible.
Who are you voting for?
Everybody has their favorite drink.
There's something in here.
I am so sorry.
I assumed it was free.
"If you are ever in Japan, come and see me."
I suppose he's got a point.
We loaded our baggage into the car.
Where did you put my umbrella?
I'd like to get back to work.
That's her.
I want a word with you.
It's obvious.
That's very big.
How do you know how heavy it is?
No one knows why.
I can prove it to you.
I don't know his whereabouts.
We spent a lot of time with them.
I never wanted to compete with you.
It will heal.
Mary is easy-going and fun.
I wanted to surprise Tom.
Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung.
I am exhausted.
You are important.
I wasn't busy last week.
What do you really think?
I was naive.
You're the last hope for humanity.
You were perfect.
I'll help you pack.
All is well with me.
You sound tired.
Who broke this window?
I thought you'd want to take a look.
It's my turn to drive next.
Are you for or against the war?
We're going out to get something to eat.
I made a snowman.
I never want to see you again.
I can do it in a week.
He should have known better.
He described exactly what happened.
I can't stand to see animals be teased.
I wear my old coat in weather like this.
You're a terrible person.
I'd like to go with you if you don't mind.
It was very windy.
It's been three years since I've seen Tom.
Do we need a universal language?
We found a secret door into the building.
How are you connected?
It's right above you.
You don't kick a man when he's down.
Does this thing actually work?
He understands her problems more or less.
Let's talk about Tom and what he's done.
We were nearly frozen to death.
He is in pajamas.
I want to make you an offer.
Tom looks intrigued.
Did you break up with Tom or did he break up with you?
He lives off campus.
They got into the boat.
We'll have breakfast at 6:30.
The king imposed heavy taxes on the people.
This is my brother's.
Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
Do you remember your grandfather?
He's writing a long letter.
A lot of people are waiting for Tom.
He walked on for some time.
What prevented him from coming?
What are you two doing?
Tom was stretched out on a sofa.
I haven't eaten for two days.
I think we should all go to Tom's house.
What's the time now?
You'll know soon enough.
We were friends.
I regret going there.
She has left her umbrella behind.
She couldn't take her eyes off him.
I can't stand it any longer.
Tom doesn't take very good care of his dog.
The Bible has it written like this.
I've never done it like that before.
Come back in a day.
This is a problem for elderly people.
All you care about is money.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
Do you have any aspirin on you?
"Look, I'll show you."
Your socks don't match.
Do you speak Bulgarian?
I did not take many photos.
I don't know how I've offended you.
There's something I have to ask you.
You won't be fired.
English is taught in most countries.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
I have lunch at noon with my friends.
Tom is very worried about what might happen.
I get chapped lips every winter.
I wanted this.
I'm reliable.
I think both of them are right.
Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution.
I fed the dog.
You're cruel.
Why don't you join me?
I left you a note.
Do you really think that your plan is realistic?
Everyone is suffering.
Great minds think alike.
My doctor has advised me to stop taking this medicine.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Don't get excited.
"You don't believe Tom, do you?"
Thanks for coming.
Who is your teacher?
May I start eating now?
This car is very expensive.
We're all in this together.
I'm not trying to say anything.
You're rude.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
Tom pressed the intercom button.
That won't work!
I ate a salad for lunch.
Where do you get your hair done?
You're very angry.
You don't have to get up so early.
This will only take a second.
How long have you waited?
It is cloudy now.
I can't judge distance.
This is what you must do.
I don't know how to thank you enough.
I said no.
He lived a happy life.
Stay out of trouble.
How would you like your steak done?
"At first, everything seemed difficult."
Life begins when you are forty.
I finally gave up.
It was very romantic.
Tom isn't happy at all.
There was a cat on the table.
I'm not surprised you don't remember.
She advised him not to use too much salt.
Try again.
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
Get them out of my sight.
It is not necessary for us to attend the meeting.
I want to convey my sympathy.
They are very big.
Could I have a screwdriver?
I felt a drop of rain on my head.
Is that your dog?
We depend on you.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
I tripped.
Nobody tells me anything.
Tom is mad.
You have to tell me the truth.
I've always wanted to try it.
I don't know them at all.
Thanks for the information.
Tom is breathing normally.
I was going to go.
Shut all the doors and windows.
"You enjoy that, don't you?"
I'll accompany you to the hospital.
He and his friend sat on the bench.
I'm afraid there isn't any coffee left.
Can I use your phone for a sec?
"On Sunday, I go to church."
I can't show you.
How do you know what I heard?
You could've died.
Would you mind coming earlier next time?
He's painting his house.
I don't think your name's Tom.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
What don't you have?
He let me go.
Tom is drunk.
I think that went well.
I'm scared of heights.
Don't forget to vote.
I agree with him.
I have business elsewhere.
Why don't we all sit down?
The only way is up.
It's hard to understand his ideas.
She'll love him forever.
I love the way you laugh.
How do you spell that word?
May I sit here?
I've been very lucky today.
My children were taken away from me.
You never get my jokes.
I'm looking for my keys. Have you seen them?
I feel really confident.
At what time did the show finish?
Mine is better than yours.
I quoted some famous phrases in my book.
I can't stand ignorant people.
They will have to cut down their expenses.
She greeted him cheerfully as she always did.
What're you doing?
I had my reasons.
I'm by your side.
How are things at home?
What should I be doing?
This is my father's.
Get on your feet.
She left her children.
You need to move on.
They are Christians.
I can recommend a good lawyer.
She advised him to go home early.
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
I hear you were grounded.
Is the dog swimming?
She was brought up by him.
I was very disappointed.
"These are just guidelines, not hard and fast rules."
Easy does it.
I'll provide you with all the necessary information.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
I can't thank you enough for the help you've given me.
A is the first letter of the alphabet.
My feet get cold.
How did you discover that?
Take the money and run.
She blackmailed him.
Remember what happened last time.
He was struck off the list.
He was listening to the music in his room.
That house needs repainting.
I'm very grateful for your help.
She was painfully thin.
I'd like to thank you all for coming.
Are you in trouble?
"You want to get out of here, don't you?"
"No matter where I go, I get lost."
That's an order that I can't give.
The meeting will be held next week at the earliest.
I love you guys.
Don't ask me to do that.
She caressed her baby lovingly.
It would take at least three hours to paint this room.
Tom paid the driver and got out of the cab.
They broke off their engagement.
No one else knows it.
Rumors of defeat were circulating.
I don't think about you.
Why did you help Tom escape?
You'll feel at home.
You might not like this.
My room number is 5.
She handed me the letter without saying anything.
I wanted to learn from the best.
I can't hear what they're saying.
So what does it mean?
I often refer to the dictionary.
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
I can see the light.
She is living abroad.
He wants to spend time with his daughter.
The sun has set.
"You don't want that, do you?"
I was wrong.
How hard can that be?
Tom had to make a fire.
I don't even want you there.
Tom is quitting.
I'll never forget the sight.
I'm leaving town for a few days.
His house was struck by lightning.
You don't want to point that gun at me.
A tall building was built next to my house.
I'm pleased to see you.
I thought you should see this contract.
They can't push us around.
I actually have to run.
Tom would do anything to get Mary's attention.
I'd like to have these pants cleaned.
Her voice could hardly be heard over the noise.
"Generally speaking, little girls are fond of dolls."
Please shut the door behind you.
Tom thought that Mary loved him.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I can spot a bleached blonde from a mile away.
Drop the gun.
"After some hesitation, he laid the book on the desk."
I'll let you get back to work.
It appears to be working.
I should be there.
I really don't care.
Could you please clear the table?
He made a thorough analysis of the problem.
Both of the brothers are dead.
What fell on me?
Do you have a pencil?
Are you mentally ill?
"After the storm, the sea was calm."
"By the way, have you heard from her since then?"
I gave him my phone number.
Can I borrow your laptop?
I speak French to my father and English to my mother.
She tied him to the chair.
Have you ever been run over?
I don't like the dark.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Yeast makes beer ferment.
That's probably safer.
She walked around looking for him.
I believe Tom is right.
Why did I trust you?
You're crazy.
I wish you'd never been born.
I want to teach you something.
No one can help me.
Not much money is required.
How many caps do you own?
Some of them were wounded.
Context is important.
Can you take a little break?
They talked about culture.
This ship was ten meters long.
I have been wanting to ask you a question.
What sort of play is it?
She advised him to do more exercise.
You have to clean your room.
I didn't ask you to stay with me.
Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
I am drinking coffee.
I want to know where you heard that.
I can't believe this is happening.
Did you see Tom at school today?
Is there anything you can do?
I'm not unhappy.
She could not swim.
He ripped his shirt open.
I'd love to talk to you.
He's going to join our club.
You'd better take care of it soon.
This is my last offer.
Tom began to search the house.
I can't stay long. I have plans.
Have fun with that.
"Frankly, I don't like that man."
I know Tom will agree.
I'm rational.
Is it large enough?
I promise I won't bite.
The meat is expensive.
You're three hours late.
He doesn't have any proof.
What're you all dressed up for?
I love the way you kiss.
You can read this book.
I really want to see you.
They'll never make it.
Tom stormed out of the meeting.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I have three sisters.
I'm a little sick.
She gave me advice as well as information.
She told him that she had seen me there last week.
I will accompany you.
I have no memory of that.
They looked everywhere.
I don't think I can eat this.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
Let me help you with those groceries.
Someone asked for you.
We must cut down our expenses.
You made me proud.
Please fill out this form.
When did you seed the lawn?
Is this sentence correct?
He is very afraid of his mother.
"If you don't like the service, don't leave a tip."
We have exams right after summer vacation.
I can show you a better time.
"You want to get out of here, don't you?"
My room is always clean.
I can hardly hear you.
He sometimes watches TV.
Which hat do you want to buy?
I didn't know what to say to him.
Would you please shut the window?
I always catch colds in the winter.
"I'm sorry, but I don't feel like going out today."
Please leave right away.
I won't let this happen.
I live in the city.
I did what I was asked.
Do you remember anything?
I don't want to be killed.
I wasn't conscious of anyone watching me.
He lied to me. That is why I am angry with him.
I think you're cute.
I'm the guy who gave Tom that hat.
How many teams are there?
I'll take care of you all.
You've done a pretty good job so far.
He drives a pickup truck.
Get out of my bed.
I know what a stapler is.
Come join us.
"Hurry up, girls."
He is a heroin addict.
I think Tom can help Mary.
I was in all day.
Which group is your friend in?
He tries.
You'll have to drive.
She managed to keep up appearances.
Was I not supposed to eat yet?
He was scolded by his teacher for being lazy.
I found it necessary to get assistance.
I don't have any books to read.
We'll try one more time.
I arrived here yesterday.
His ideas never earned him a single penny.
We have little chance of winning.
Do not interfere!
Where does this piece go?
I figured you might change your mind.
How did you manage to do that?
I thought it was good.
Don't confuse astrology with astronomy.
Can they see us?
I never meant for any of this to happen.
Tom was unsatisfied with the results.
I need to have a word with you in my office.
I don't want to offend you.
I really like being with you.
Why did you run away?
Have you read any good books lately?
Tom's eyes were glued to the screen.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
Do you know where she lives?
You don't need to go there.
Money doesn't necessarily make you happier.
She is not afraid of anything.
She shouldn't go by herself.
"You're wealthy, aren't you?"
"You've put on weight, haven't you?"
Don't take any prisoners.
There were no railroads.
We found something.
I didn't have to go.
She didn't exactly agree with me.
No one moved.
Tom bought me this book.
I couldn't finish it.
Please come to my house in the afternoon.
Stop badgering me.
Could you make it a little shorter for me?
These people hate all foreigners.
Are you bringing your camera?
Can you come over and talk?
Running away isn't the answer.
You haven't told me your name yet.
I'm too old for her.
She gave me a pretty doll.
"The roads are slippery, so please be careful."
Please go to the bank.
This is a painting.
I don't mind at all.
Do you work well under pressure?
Are you sure that you want to go there?
Nothing is planned.
Zap it in the microwave for thirty seconds.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
She was advised by him to get more exercise.
We should wait.
You're going to be OK.
You broke your arm.
What were you thinking of?
I came here to give you a gift.
"I've been thinking about you, too."
Her novel has been translated into Japanese.
Tell us a joke.
I don't know what came over me.
Tom asked Mary why she was smiling.
I am sorry to trouble you.
How are you going to do that?
Do you study any foreign language?
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
You can choose whichever color you like.
Do you have a knife?
Come whenever you want.
Tom should learn French.
What'll we do if Tom is late?
How many people were killed in the store?
This is my mother.
I'm not who you think I am.
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore.
Your friends are waiting for you.
I'm not leaving the two of you alone.
Those boots are Tom's.
I'd like to have some hot chocolate.
I don't watch that show.
He is very mean to me.
You don't know that.
Tom is very unpredictable.
I will forgive him out of consideration for you.
His birthday is August 21st.
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.
I felt like I was intruding.
Tom bought a house in Boston.
The house seemed empty.
He doesn't know any better.
"Don't worry, I'm going to help you."
My parents won't let me have a dog.
I recognized her the moment I saw her.
They were all surprised to see me there.
He'll wait for you.
A winter sport that many people enjoy is ice skating.
A cookie is under the table.
I was very nervous.
They live near the beach.
Tom tells me you're his assistant.
I wish you had told me the truth then.
You weren't even there.
How do you live like this?
I'll take care of it right now.
I like figuring things out.
Give me a glass of water.
I own this place.
Tom speaks French very fluently.
I think we should head back.
Did I wake you?
I did what you asked.
I have a slight headache now.
Don't you remember what you said?
I will have it uploaded by Friday.
The housing situation shows no hope of improvement.
Can the rumor be true?
I don't need any rest.
They're special.
Goodbyes are always sad.
They invited me to play cards.
I opened one eye.
We're going upstairs.
The hotel we stayed at last summer is near the lake.
I am not always free on Sundays.
How did you manage to win?
How long do you plan to stay in this country?
He won the first prize at the chess tournament.
Can I go now?
I don't think it's a wolf.
I have a terrible toothache.
We only kissed.
How many galaxies are there in the universe?
Tom told me he didn't take French in high school.
I chickened out.
This isn't my key.
"Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood."
We are in a library.
I thought Tom would be hungry.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Don't say that word.
He made a robot.
Are you a Japanese student?
We won.
I outrank you.
We've got enough.
She brought me a cup of tea.
I have breakfast at seven every morning.
Shall I get you a chair?
Will you turn on the television?
We have a lot of great guys on our team.
The city supplied the needy with blankets.
I'd like to hear what your opinion is.
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
"Be polite, but firm."
Don't worry about what others say.
You should do all you can to help your neighbours.
Are you old enough to drive?
Relax a moment.
He shares a room.
He is good at gymnastics.
See if my answer is correct.
I showed her my room.
I like to read books.
You need to be more patient.
I like that it is soft.
Tom has two brothers who live in Boston.
I think we can help each other.
Do you think it's going to snow?
I am yours and you are mine.
One of your neighbors complained.
What scared you?
She emerged from the kitchen.
Tom will always remember you.
It's our only hope.
Alcohol lowers inhibitions.
He looks as if he had been ill.
"You were drunk, weren't you?"
Minnesota's state bird is the mosquito.
It's ridiculous.
They want you dead.
"I hear you, but I don't see you."
He joined the opposing team.
Bring a camera.
They have been busy.
That's my girlfriend you're talking to.
I don't know if I have enough money.
There is nothing wrong with him.
You're very generous.
They relaxed on the beach.
Have you tried that before?
I don't have time to do the laundry.
Humans aren't the only animals that use tools.
I will try again.
What happened here?
That's why I've done all this.
Tom speaks French better than his classmates.
This dictionary is mine.
This book has a lot of pictures.
It's not a gift.
"At first, I didn't believe you."
I feel like I know you already.
I just want to know who's in the room.
We try to go to Boston at least once a year.
They kept him waiting outside for a long time.
God created the world.
All my friends say that.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
The hat costs less than the coat.
I was just trying to impress him.
I found out when we're supposed to arrive.
I saw a flock of sheep.
I love nature.
I believe it will snow tomorrow.
We have more to do.
They found each other.
Don't depend too much on others.
It looks fine.
He proceeded to the next question.
We needed this.
We're just going to talk.
I'll go and get your coat.
China is a huge country.
The young should respect the old.
He is busy preparing for the trip.
There's no place like home.
Severe weather frightens people.
How could you do that?
Choose one.
He is going to be a doctor when he grows up.
Tom doesn't need it.
I have to replace the radio's battery.
I don't want to play golf.
The fugitive crossed the river.
You must teach me what you know.
It's just a formality.
When did it end?
It's impossible to describe.
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
Are you still awake?
Come quickly!
I was very tired.
Help me hide this money.
I hadn't considered not going to the meeting.
Choose your favorite racket.
The living room in my new house is very large.
I always have a good supply of tissues in my pockets.
He has a hairy chest.
This doesn't prove anything.
How can I get to the zoo from here?
Did anyone eat with you?
I think I'm right.
I am hanging up my shirts.
He keeps his word.
I care a good deal about what you think.
I'm terrible at tennis.
Did I hear you right?
Can you tell me the time?
I don't know what I'm going to do yet.
"We've finished the work, so we may as well go home."
This is non-negotiable.
Will you please help me?
Are your hands clean?
I liked your dancing.
He cleared out his desk.
I was attacked.
I hope that I can do it.
She hired him as a programmer.
We all have jobs to do.
There is no room for doubt about his guilt.
What he says sounds very sensible to me.
I appreciate your time.
Show me where it happened.
He always leaves the window open when he sleeps.
You've been infected.
My mother took my temperature.
I know Tom understands.
They're not coming.
The sky was clear when I left home.
"You live here alone, don't you?"
Tom doesn't dress like everybody else.
I must go alone.
This food is gluten-free.
I find you very attractive.
I don't know what I want to do with my life.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
Who are you supposed to be?
You should take her advice.
It's been three years since we got married.
They love that song.
I don't know why I said that.
He let the dog loose in the garden.
I had to go back home.
Tom will be busy tomorrow.
Can you give me Tom's address?
I fell down the stairs.
I want to hear all about it.
Did you show it to your parents?
I've made this trip a thousand times.
She bought a handkerchief for ten dollars.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
They want you to resign.
He wants to live closer to nature.
"If your child drinks poison, rush him to the hospital."
It's warmer.
You cannot heal a broken heart.
Where do you all live?
It would be stupid to say no.
This place is arguably the best restaurant in London.
She wanted him to stay longer.
Tom doesn't like my friends.
Pleased to meet you.
That was a pretty stupid thing to do.
You're grumpy.
His new film is disappointing.
What are you crying for?
Nobody wants it.
I've already had a coffee.
You can tell me the truth.
We're very excited about that.
Have I answered your question?
I swim almost every day.
Time travel is possible.
There's been a complication.
She adores him.
"I'll graduate this year, I hope."
You know where I'm going.
It's a travesty.
You know what you must do.
Get these people out of here.
My girlfriend is crying.
They made us work all day.
I'll see if I can find a map.
We need to go.
"You bought it from Tom, didn't you?"
There's a book about dancing on the desk.
This book is both interesting and instructive.
Try not to be so tense.
I know you're not like that.
I'll say what I have to say.
I really can't talk about this.
I'm not sure how to answer this.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
I don't live here anymore.
I shouldn't have slept in.
How are you feeling tonight?
Please give me a glass of water.
I've already spoken to Tom about that.
That's how he invented the machine.
She would not disclose the secret.
Truer words have never been spoken.
I often lie about my age.
I bought lots of books.
We all want Tom to be happy.
She talked to the chairperson.
That was only a figure of speech.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
She always dresses in black.
What kind of sports do you do?
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I don't understand why you're leaving.
Do you watch the news every day?
I don't want you to get the wrong impression.
School starts at 8:40.
Our trip was canceled due to the heavy snow.
"You're new here, aren't you?"
Will you help me for a minute?
He asked for more money.
I'm afraid he cannot come.
Is today your birthday?
I regret saying that.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
"Speak slowly, please."
I haven't said yes yet.
Looks like I will become a dad.
He is cranky.
Are you looking for someone?
He expressed his opinion in a few words.
Can you help me install this software?
I am content with my job.
You can see the whole park from the restaurant.
It's almost time.
Stay where you are. I'm on my way.
She began to sing.
I don't know if that's possible.
You make me sick.
But I was careful.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
I've won.
How do we stop Tom?
I heard a noise in the bedroom.
Why do you want to go out with me?
He sold all his land.
It is beyond my power.
Do you want to say goodbye?
I read a lot of books last summer.
I don't remember.
We can talk in front of Tom.
I don't like being interrogated.
I like to be here.
"""Are you sad?"" ""No. Why would I be?"""
He thought of a good solution.
What happened to all that money?
Please wait around for a while.
I'm coming right away.
I only need a minute.
She said that she was happy.
I can't remember how to use this machine.
We have a party tomorrow evening.
Leave me.
Tom was an accountant.
I don't want to live by your rules.
Don't scribble here.
I have a schedule to keep.
I love the way you talk.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
She's loved by her friends.
Never mind what happened.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
Have you seen my watch?
I had to walk here because my car broke down.
I'm still thinking about the riddle.
The house is said to be haunted.
The fact that they came here is undeniable.
What should we do if he comes late?
That's why we want you.
Read it to me.
Go ahead and talk.
I'd be happy to discuss it.
"Funny, I don't remember that."
Rules are made to be broken.
She quit her job for some reason.
You should not go alone.
The church is just across the street.
We really hope another war will not break out.
I wanted to make new friends.
What he says is total nonsense.
How old is this stuff?
May I see you tomorrow?
He advertised his house for sale.
This decision is final.
Tom is waiting for you.
You know I love you!
You don't seem too sure.
I need a job.
Give me your phone.
We don't need you anymore.
She sat next to him on the bus.
You should be able to walk in a few days.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I didn't know what it was at the time.
The suspect was innocent of the crime.
Tom didn't tell me this.
My wife is a doctor.
He forgave me breaking my promise.
Tom doesn't have the will power to quit smoking.
Invite whoever you like.
You're not dead.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
How did you know where I'd be?
I love reading.
"This is yours, isn't it?"
Please correct my pronunciation.
"Since he was tired, he went to bed."
I thought you were injured.
Tom filed a patent for his invention.
When did your father come home?
You're very understanding.
You can't learn that in school.
Take this medicine. You will feel better soon.
It's all in my report.
Could you just turn around for a second?
My bicycle has a flat.
I just thought you might want to go skiing with us.
Don't tell anyone we've done this.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
I never have had occasion to use it.
All hope is gone.
It seems that he's happy.
I don't know how to swim.
Tom is a perfect stranger to me.
She keeps her hair long.
Would you mind babysitting my kids?
We're not staying.
"He is rarely, if ever, late for appointments."
That's a wonderful idea.
Your book is on the desk.
You're kind.
Are you with someone?
Tom will be very successful someday.
Your ideas are different from mine.
Who is that pretty girl?
Do you know anyone who needs a job?
I'm ready to start.
The witch hunt has begun.
Is this yours?
It happened in Rome.
I'm looking for a sweater.
"In my opinion, she is correct."
I want to talk about it now.
Tom is living in Boston.
That was his catchphrase.
Can you please repeat the question?
I should stop procrastinating.
Do your very best.
This word comes from Greek.
Tom didn't suspect a thing.
Men and women need each other.
Come right in.
He can play the guitar.
Can you please close the window?
Many lost their homes during the earthquake.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while."
Wow! It's been a long time.
We're very excited.
She turned against her old friend.
I know you're working part-time.
It isn't over yet.
I like walking.
I was waiting for that question.
He didn't like school.
Let me spell it out for you.
That child grew a lot in a short amount of time.
I saw you snickering.
I was paraphrasing.
We've been friends for a long time.
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up.
My father is an early riser.
"Tom, I've got a surprise for you."
Stand aside.
Let's go outside and sit in the garden.
He said that he had told you to speak more slowly.
It's an excuse.
Why are you all sad?
It's too sunny to stay inside.
They finished building the bridge on time.
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
This is what I want to do.
What are you complaining about?
Would you like to come in?
I just don't feel like doing that tonight.
A detective arrived upon the scene of the crime.
I love cooking.
You have a fertile imagination.
No one is at fault.
You need a license to drive a car.
Why would you do that without telling us?
He finally made a name for himself as a politician.
Don't forget your toothbrush.
I'm sick of this hot weather.
You seem to have the wrong number.
I informed her of my success.
Do you ever think about that guy?
That's just common sense.
Don't come near me. I have a cold.
My room has a large closet.
Tom and Mary got into an argument.
We can't just leave Tom here by himself.
You caught me off-guard.
What is your mother tongue?
I will be very careful.
He always speaks well of her.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom is currently living in Boston.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I can't sleep when I'm stressed out.
Tom doesn't really understand French.
Speaking English is very difficult for me.
A bead of sweat started forming on his brow.
I have just returned from Britain.
Everyone was hurt.
How is your new class?
They're here until the end of the week.
Do you want anything?
What is the second largest country in the world?
I'm happy you're here.
I can't put up with that noise any longer.
What do you think now?
She can't stand being treated like a child.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
You're all alone.
It's not an easy sport.
No one is sure how many people died.
This is boring.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
Is he looking?
Where did everybody go?
I was just trying to protect you.
I've never seen anything like it.
Don't use too much water.
They're right behind you.
She married a hotshot lawyer from New York.
I remember that feeling.
I don't gossip.
I don't know Russian.
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
He is good at driving.
How are things at school?
I don't mind a bit.
Don't touch the stove.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
We'll dine together and then go to the theater.
I don't need to go to the doctor.
Show me the way to the bus stop.
He inherited the business from his father.
Everybody laughed at Tom.
This is your captain speaking.
I'll never forgive him.
No proof was ever found.
I promise you I'll come early.
Please don't forget to shut the door.
She was advised by him to work harder.
This suitcase is too heavy for me to carry.
You shouldn't trust Tom.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't have a brother.
I know you're not serious.
They gathered at a farm in New York State.
I ironed the handkerchief.
What you said makes absolutely no sense to me.
He can't find his hat.
Will you exchange this sweater for a larger one?
We have a reservation for six-thirty.
There was a light rain yesterday.
I can't eat this much food.
"No matter what game he plays, he always wins."
I bet you didn't know that.
She smiled.
He spoke highly of you.
Take care of this.
Everybody's crying.
We survived.
Don't underestimate my power.
I never had a girlfriend before.
I think it's time for me to give her a ride home.
I'm happy that it's over.
She is as beautiful as ever.
They're amazing.
I thought you'd want it back.
You can't do this to yourself.
We've got company.
"Fortunately, no one was hurt."
Do you see the entrance of the park?
This will not cost too much.
Was that you on TV last night?
Do I have to undress?
The wind blew the umbrella out of her hand.
Please come here.
"This is really delicious soup, isn't it?"
"Hurry up, please."
Any of you can do it.
No further discussion is necessary.
I run this place.
They didn't see anything.
You might try that.
She speaks good English.
They're just for you.
I have enough money to buy it.
He is to come to my house tonight.
I don't have time now.
I can't believe that you enjoyed that movie.
I can't believe you actually did that.
We can't all be perfect.
Tom doesn't want Mary to go anywhere without him.
Isn't that true?
What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
Choose something.
You should go home.
He took off his coat.
It was very cold.
I wish you'd never been born.
It may not be a dream.
She lives on a small pension.
Tom knows what the problem is.
Tom lost the race.
I'm afraid we have no choice.
He will not go.
I have something I want to tell you.
"What does not kill me, makes me stronger."
The statue is missing its head.
Who sent you?
That's good for a first try.
I don't know what's happened.
Was Tom telling the truth?
Put this in your backpack.
He was wrong.
No one laughed.
Health means everything.
What do you have in your hand?
I want to write all of this down.
It's our duty to help.
How do I thank you?
I just want to be loved.
The new fur coats were displayed in the window.
I didn't want to involve you.
We'll do it together.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
Michael Jackson has passed away.
This is yours.
Tom'll call.
Are you American?
Are you all set?
You can't give up.
How was work today?
She held her breath.
This place is disgusting.
You're very brave.
I don't have a fever.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
You can pick out any book you like.
He threw me the apple.
That's a horse of a different colour.
There is nothing to worry about.
How old were you when your father was killed?
It'll take some time to get used to wearing a wig.
What are you trying to prove?
I won't bore you with the details.
Do you like Moscow?
Do I have to make a speech?
Forty people can't fit in here.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
I'd like to see you try it.
Where's the train station?
Did you volunteer us?
We have a plan.
The house is in need of repair.
She invited him in for a cup of coffee.
I'm slightly hungry.
The sun sets in the west.
The climate here is mild.
Don't pull the plug yet.
I just wanted to say that I love you.
I can't do this by myself.
You don't sound very surprised.
Today I don't feel like doing anything.
Wait!
I made up my mind to go there.
This is pretty bad.
This doesn't surprise me.
Life is often compared to a voyage.
It's like being a kid in a candy store.
She's a real hottie.
You misunderstood me.
Have you ever been betrayed by a good friend?
They're all mine.
Are you afraid of the dark?
Don't give up on your dreams.
I don't really want to learn French.
Please phone him.
Why do you care so much?
I cannot lift this stone.
I disobeyed you.
I feel very chilly.
They believe in God.
"I'm busy, so I can't go."
I walk in the forest every day.
We buy stationery in bulk.
I enjoy taking pictures.
This bicycle belongs to my brother.
I'm a purist.
You know the law.
Who took part in the contest?
It makes me so happy.
We will make every effort to do so.
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
He was a rugby player.
Can you come on Sunday evening?
What makes you think I'm hiding something?
Tom wants to talk to Mary.
Please let in some fresh air.
Where's your father?
What did I get?
Stay away from my daughter.
"""Thank you for helping me."" ""Don't mention it."""
I suddenly became dizzy.
I'll give you a ride.
When did you begin learning English?
I want one!
London is among the world's largest cities.
I watched a Swedish movie last night.
There is an urgent need for clean energy.
I know neither of his brothers.
Tom needs to work.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
Have some pity on me.
I like to swim in the afternoon.
She pointed her finger at him accusingly.
We're still a team.
Don't cross this bridge.
"Pass me the salt and pepper, please."
That company produces microchips.
Open the safe.
This gun is reportedly very powerful.
Who turned off the light?
I didn't say you were crazy.
I need to be alone for a while.
I‘m ironing my handkerchiefs.
That's not something you forget.
Tom is unbelievable.
"At least, no one was hurt."
Are you in favor of or against that policy?
People were evacuated because of the flood.
Where are my cigarettes?
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I don't have any children yet.
They lost again.
I can't think of his name just now.
I don't know what's going on around here.
Go to school.
Here's my account number.
I finally caught up with my friends.
The urban population of America is increasing.
I know that won't happen again.
They are all very hungry.
Thank you for doing that for me.
I mistook you for your brother.
Somebody stole my car.
"He was very tall, so I recognized him at once."
Get down from there.
No problem.
I'm happy you liked it.
I remembered wrong.
I'd like to talk to Tom myself.
You are very beautiful.
He went by bicycle.
I expect that Tom will pass the exam.
When are you going home?
Why did you stay home yesterday?
Her husband is about to die.
I still think this is the best choice.
The building that I saw was very large.
I thought you needed money.
You've bought more stamps than necessary.
Did someone follow us here?
I don't care about fashion.
Drink some tea.
Why don't you give me a break?
A thief broke into the house to steal the money.
I think you need a lawyer.
We want to buy a house in Boston.
It seems to me that something is wrong.
You're the one who trained me.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
I felt bad afterwards.
Tom seems to be waiting for someone.
It was a very long meeting.
I'm getting tired. It's your turn to drive.
He went fishing in the river.
Is she here yet?
"If you see a mistake, then please correct it."
Please write it down.
"Come on, Tom, you're making me blush."
The world is changing.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I will go tomorrow morning at seven.
You're totally right.
It is not easy to get rid of bad habits.
He told a funny story.
Is that ring made of real gold?
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
It is useless to talk to him.
He considered himself lucky.
My dad gave up alcohol.
You shouldn't drink this water.
This summer we'll go to the mountains and to the sea.
Tom said he would be here.
Simplicity is a virtue.
I can't do this by myself.
You can bank on that.
How are you connected?
He said that he would help me.
He must have entered this room.
I wasn't listening to the radio.
She went to see him reluctantly.
We can't help you anymore.
Tom made himself a cup of tea.
We're getting a new car next month.
We're going to do everything we can.
You have to try again.
He can't be under thirty.
They look similar in some ways.
What made you change your mind all of a sudden?
You made the same mistake as last time.
She forgot that she bought him a present.
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
This is pretty extreme.
That's exactly what I meant.
You look a little pale.
To learn a foreign language requires a lot of time.
I fell into the pool.
I want you to handle it.
Anybody can make a mistake.
We would have helped them.
He gave me a piece of advice.
She is aggressive.
She told us that we must call a doctor immediately.
They're coming.
There's an emergency.
Did I wake you?
You're very flexible.
I know what they are thinking.
"Which do you prefer, apples or bananas?"
I sometimes watch TV.
Does he do any sports?
I have many model cars.
I don't have time to be sick.
I'll see to it first thing tomorrow.
It's hard for me to express ideas through words.
He noticed her embarrassment.
I don't have any evidence.
Both are alive.
Tom doesn't know who to ask.
I can't reach things on the top shelf.
Please eat something.
The costs are too high.
They were unimpressed.
"You know I have no choice, don't you?"
Your time is up.
Why do you like squirrels so much?
Are you mad?
I should be in charge.
It's healthy to breathe deeply.
The prisoner escaped from prison.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
He seems to know all about her past.
Mars is a planet.
He's the class clown.
Would you step aside?
Tom is a well-known singer.
I didn't want any of that.
Don't try to make me angry.
Nobody would listen to me.
There's room for improvement.
"At this point, I don't need money."
Tom said that Mary died in her sleep.
I'll do this as long as I can.
I don't want any problems.
The tour guide can speak three languages.
The escaped convict is armed and dangerous.
Tom bought Mary many gifts.
Are you the manager?
Let's cross here.
We work to earn money.
What movie was it that you told me I should watch?
I didn't take anything.
I don't like the way he talks.
She pretended not to hear him yesterday.
"So, why are you here?"
"Tom is very late, isn't he?"
Can you repair this?
Tom didn't say what you said he said.
It's no use pretending that you can't speak French.
She attacked him with her fists.
Let's get out for a while to take a walk.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
Don't bother to call me.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
He did not work on Sunday night.
You won't be shot.
I think we've got a problem.
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't know how they do it.
Tom doesn't trust us.
He talks well.
I love my yellow sweater.
He loves coffee.
Where's the rest of my money?
I want you to go somewhere.
What will the newspapers say?
All the villagers know of the accident.
They fought the measures in the courts.
Tom is kind to everybody.
Do I have to undress?
This is the man I've been waiting for.
I guess that'll be up to you.
Crime is down.
I'm not sleepy.
How come the sky is blue?
It was a huge project.
That's what I'd try to do.
You're the one who trained me.
Tom is thinking about getting married.
You're my boss.
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
A frown may express anger or displeasure.
Who was it that bought those pictures yesterday?
These gifts are for you.
I didn't hear her coming.
I'll give you as many as you like.
I saw Tom and Mary talking to each other this morning.
Never say never.
It is useless to go on strike now.
Have you gone nuts?
The pleasure is mine.
She sued him.
These houses were dark and dirty.
Read this passage and translate it into Japanese.
Send the kids to bed.
You won't believe who came by today.
Are you ready to begin?
He's so cute.
How good are you?
I want to get a haircut before I go on the trip.
Tom hates you.
Somehow I thought you'd say that.
I never learned how to write.
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
I sent a message to Tom.
I hope you'll soon get well.
A mouse is running around the room.
I'm surprised Tom never mentioned you.
May I borrow your car?
You just don't know how it feels.
She promised to marry him.
Tom isn't the only one here that can speak French.
Choose your weapon.
How much did you have to pay for the tickets?
The rooms are all clean.
You shouldn't pop your bubble gum in class.
You're a thief.
I like working with you.
I don't know what to do next.
Which newspaper would you prefer?
This could take a while.
I'm illiterate.
Do you want me to go home?
You're the one who planted that tree.
Add 5 to 3 and you have 8.
I was really unlucky.
I don't know this game.
I can't put up with this smell.
Please refrain from smoking here.
Eat whatever you like.
She handed him his jacket.
Why not start now?
Why did you come over here?
No one said anything like that.
Tom knew he had a problem.
No one escaped alive.
That only makes the problem worse.
Your camera is only half the size of mine.
Food will be included.
Don't waste your time trying to convince Tom.
Can you tell me how to get to the train station?
Give it to me straight.
How dare you call me stupid!
That's exactly what I think.
He is acquainted with the custom.
This fluid can be substituted for glue.
I want to meet with Tom.
Have another drink.
He likes new experiences.
You don't have to answer.
Tom could do with some help.
You probably just want to be alone.
She advised him to exercise.
How do you want to handle it?
I don't hate you.
Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
"Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus."
This is a coincidence.
Do you come here a lot?
You can't stop progress.
I think he was angry.
Speak into the microphone.
Sugar is bad for your teeth.
He is respected by everybody.
She fell down and hurt her knee.
It's bad for the heart.
Do you want to see her very much?
Are you brushing your teeth properly?
Lock the door when you go out.
I didn't say it like that.
They asserted that it was true.
Lesson Two is easy.
She forgot to feed the dog.
Why don't you give me a break?
Look before you leap.
Tom said he wanted to take a nap.
The door is locked at nine o'clock.
There's a good view of Mt. Akagi from upstairs.
I was chosen to do that.
That's all that happened.
He lied to me.
He wants you to come home.
That's my cat.
Tom helped me with the move.
Do you know why she's so angry?
Park the car in the shade.
I wonder why he did that.
I had a hard day.
I'm as curious as you are.
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV.
Are you guys all right?
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
His appearance deceived me.
Did I ask you?
I want you to go upstairs.
You'll be crying before long.
It looks like you're trying to grow a beard.
They talked over the plan for hours.
Tom is the star of the show.
I've got to get to the airport.
I'm glad you're my friend.
I wrote a letter yesterday.
You're in grave danger.
Please write down your name.
The train was late this morning.
Timing is everything.
I don't drink before noon.
The car came to a smooth stop.
They arrived at the hotel.
Tom doesn't know which color to choose.
I want the money you owe me and I want it now.
I knew you weren't really dead.
He is washing his car.
We don't need anyone else.
Look at it.
You look European.
No one works there anymore.
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
I just have to do something.
The truck made a sharp turn to the right.
The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
One should always do one's best.
I caught a cold two days ago.
How do you pronounce your last name?
Tom and I went to a party last night.
Do I have to study?
My mother is busy in the kitchen.
I did everything you asked.
We're one of the best teams in the world.
Cats can see in the dark.
Go away before they see you here.
Everything is going fine.
I don't have a bicycle.
Have you told me everything?
I just thought you might want to talk.
The results are by no means satisfactory.
"On the whole, my company is doing well now."
Tom lives in a bad neighborhood.
I didn't mean to offend Tom.
"Mary is not poor. On the contrary, she is quite rich."
She's a model.
It's a nice day and I feel like taking a walk.
The door is locked at nine every night.
I ordered Chinese food.
My mother is an early riser.
Tom has to lose weight.
Send the kids to bed.
Tom has gone somewhere.
Do it the way he tells you to.
I left home early so I wouldn't miss the train.
Tom is kind and generous.
That's what I should've said.
Can you forget your native language?
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
Don't try to fool me.
She left her ticket at home.
I know you're richer than me.
The water has boiled away.
I was lucky.
Tom tried to hit Mary.
They arrived too soon.
Did I hurt you?
This road goes to the park.
Tom made a costly mistake.
Birds fly in the sky.
We understand.
They must have had an accident.
I hate spiders.
We appreciate your hard work.
That dog is exactly twice the size of this one.
I closed my eyes to calm down.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
He did a real snow job on my daughter.
Are we prepared?
We worry about your future.
Some voters waited hours to vote.
I don't know what I was expecting.
My mother gets up early in the morning.
Copper conducts electricity well.
I don't think I'm unimaginative.
You may stay here as long as you keep quiet.
Everybody likes her.
She has fallen in love with me.
I was scared that you might leave me.
Is this all yours?
I'm getting up at six o'clock tomorrow morning.
You're the one who planted that tree.
I suppose you've already bought a ticket.
That's the reason why I couldn't attend the meeting.
"This will never happen again, I swear to you."
Why did they hire you?
I had a nice long chat with my girlfriend's father.
I visited Boston.
I think I ate a little too much today.
He is at the office.
Keep away from the dog.
Tom doesn't have a choice.
That guy gives me the creeps.
She'll make a good wife.
Somebody caught me by the arm.
Don't be so lazy.
I feel better already.
Cheers!
We're right here.
You can't believe a word he says.
"If you do not have this book, you can buy it."
Get your clothes on.
I don't mind a bit.
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
I am 19 years old.
It's nice to be needed.
What did you have for lunch today?
He runs the business with his sons.
I've been waiting for you for 5 hours.
Tom isn't feeling at all well.
Why are you lying?
Do they know that we know?
There's nothing going on here.
They all have drinks.
Tom always speaks French.
I see how you did that.
They have just arrived.
You may swim.
I thought I heard you.
My aunt looks young.
I've always loved you.
I was a bad student.
I don't feel like playing either.
He is used to traveling.
"You're not tired, are you?"
You're not leaving until I say it's OK.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
I'm not ashamed.
I work as a museum attendant.
"Finally, we arrived in England."
I made an effort to finish my work.
You're overemotional.
I took for granted that he got homesick.
I'd like to buy a good dictionary.
I'm not a violent person.
He is in front of the door.
Your idea is similar to mine.
Grab as much as you need.
The movie was a little disappointing.
I know you're upset.
He lay on his back on the bed.
How did you happen to see them doing it?
She applied her handkerchief to his wound.
He was reluctant to answer.
The audience consisted mainly of students.
I can't eat or drink very hot things.
"If you act like a child, you will be treated as such."
I'll call you later today.
Ask me tomorrow.
Will you glance through this report?
What I wanted was water.
He is off duty today.
You can't erase the past.
Did he pass the exam?
You have only to ask for it.
It's improbable.
Where's your sister?
"Tom is really busy, isn't he?"
What would you do in my place?
She wasn't able to meet him.
Hold the box with both hands.
"You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?"
We communicate with one another by means of language.
You'd better go in person.
I don't like people looking at me.
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
It'd definitely be worth it to expand on your idea.
This canoe is not safe.
Don't go too far into the woods.
I knew you couldn't do it.
I love you people.
Forget Tom.
I'd better get back to work now.
They complained of the room being too hot.
Do you have a family?
Could you please be quiet?
I cannot understand what happened.
You can't kill both of us.
Do you know him?
I can't stand that noise anymore.
I hear Tom hates you.
The boy feared the dark.
Can you solve this problem?
Did you see a brown wallet around here?
What was the hotel called? I can't remember.
The joke was at my expense.
Don't come to me with any excuses.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
How long have you been in this town?
Don't rub it in.
I don't want to be chosen.
I can't believe that actually happened.
This is an important night.
I wish this was all over.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
Could you draw a map for me?
We'll be late for class.
I can't imagine that's true.
Did you just hear what you said?
Tom has come up with another good idea.
She asked him for help.
Let me handle it.
Eat whatever you like.
He was excommunicated.
They acted on the information.
That's what I'd want.
What he said was not true.
I study French with Tom three times a week.
I can see that now.
How do you not understand?
You must make allowance for his lack of experience.
I was threatened.
"Finally, he reached his goal."
I saw a stranger enter that house.
They don't like to do that.
She went to the hairdresser's.
I second the motion.
He's curious about everything.
I was arrested on the spot.
Where did the accident take place?
The women are working.
I will speak to him alone.
"Even if it rains, I will start early tomorrow morning."
Tom had never hit me before.
Tom hurried out of the building.
I don't care who Tom is talking to.
You don't need to answer that letter.
Can I say it aloud?
Let's say no more about it.
They forgot to lock the door.
Try and do your homework by yourself.
Do you read Tom's blog?
I like dogs very much.
I'd like to earn some more money.
Tom said he thought Mary was afraid.
All you have to do is to hand this book to him.
It's a popular idea.
I want to find a way for us to be happy.
I had expected him at the meeting.
They did not give up hope.
I read one of his works.
Now leave us.
Please pass me the salt.
How can you be sure of that?
You're not invincible.
I feel a little insecure.
I know your type.
I saw a black cat run into the house.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
A cucumber is related to a watermelon.
A lot of people are dealing with allergies now.
Why don't you love me?
What was this all about?
She closed her diary slowly.
I hate it here.
You're so beautiful in that dress.
I think it's time for us to come to an agreement.
I'm the one who built this.
I will deal with them myself.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
Many students have failed the test.
You should allow an hour to get to the airport.
What insects have you eaten?
They worked through the night.
I'm the killer.
Stay out of my room.
You had better put on a raincoat.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
They didn't obey their parents.
Tom is whistling.
Are you looking for something?
I like swimming.
There is a cat in the kitchen.
I don't feel safe here anymore.
It gets worse.
It's an extreme case.
What is he aiming at?
I saw Tom take your keys.
I treated her as my own daughter.
His story is well worth listening to.
I'll tell you about it when I get home.
I had that weird dream again last night.
I want to follow you wherever you're going.
Don't even try it.
I've upset you.
My father neither drinks nor smokes.
We're all ready for that.
I can't make heads or tails of what you say.
No one has anything.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
I didn't know that you used to work here.
You're always singing.
I thought I told you to trim your beard.
Tom didn't need it anymore.
She showed me her album.
Never tell anyone.
She is one of my friends.
Is that what he wants?
I need some volunteers.
I guess you must be very hungry.
I'm not going to tell you my name.
You can't help now. It's too late.
"I just want to look at it, that's all."
I'm smarter than you.
I thought I knew what to do.
I can't figure out how to solve this problem.
He thinks I'm jealous.
I promise you I'll come early.
The volcano erupts at regular intervals.
A full moon is shining bright in the sky.
I began to sweat.
Let me borrow that.
Stay here all night if you want.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
She surprised him with a small gift.
It was her that told me.
I'll miss you.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
I can't order Tom to do it.
Tom asked me where I lived.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
It cost a lot of money to repair the car.
Shouldn't you be at work now?
This room is comfortable.
Who are you talking about?
I think we should quit.
We traveled around the world last year.
Don't tell me to relax.
Let's plug up the hole.
He is old enough to drive a car.
I thought we could talk.
This is sick.
Can I see the special exhibit with this ticket?
I've been really lonely these past two weeks.
Keep away from the fire.
What did they hit you with?
He has gone out.
Be prepared.
I was miserable without you.
I didn't see you.
Can I go first?
"Don't drink too much, okay?"
I beg your pardon. I didn't think this was your seat.
I blew the candle out.
I figured I might be able to help.
The groom left the bride standing at the altar.
I cleared the table.
He was disappointed.
I have a few friends here.
How do you say that in Italian?
Tell your wife every day that you love her.
I can't stop him.
"But very soon, the battle would become fierce."
Why were you absent yesterday?
You are taller than me.
How will he pay his debts?
We want to make a simple change.
I bought an electric car.
I want to see this.
They want you to resign.
"It's mine, not hers."
Ask him his name.
Tom told us to take our time.
She turned her old dress into a skirt.
Everybody cheered.
I tried it.
I'm not entirely sure.
They are the same age.
You will need a bodyguard.
That child wants some friends to play with.
I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
I love Christmas songs.
They regarded him as the best doctor in town.
Tom's innocent.
I got my ears pierced.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
I'm just as confused as you are.
I interpreted her silence as a refusal.
It's odd.
I know what to expect.
We must look after her children this evening.
I'm very frustrated.
Whoever told you such a ridiculous story?
I have some errands to run.
I'm pretty sure Tom's reliable.
You must control yourself.
Sign here.
He saved her at the cost of his own life.
I'll see you a week from today.
Here he comes.
She rejected him.
They concluded he was lying.
I've never done harm to anyone.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
I could swim faster when I was young.
We'll all be there.
How's your old lady doing?
Maybe you should just leave Tom alone.
It's a nice day today.
You do like living dangerously.
She always buys expensive clothes.
He borrowed the car from his friend.
Don't give up.
Could you speak a little louder please?
Your book is here.
The negotiations are at a very delicate stage.
How many letters are there in the English alphabet?
They are all the same.
I made a decision.
Who's taking responsibility for the loss?
I'm quiet.
He takes after his father.
Please show me your notebook.
Tom is lying.
No one knew who did it.
We're through.
Tom just died.
Coming here was a mistake.
We were all concerned.
Be on time.
He was paralyzed with terror.
See for yourself.
Where are you from?
"Tom, it's not your fault."
How do you do this?
Have a look.
Tom could've done it by himself.
I don't see the appeal.
Do you have any questions about what needs to be done?
He can run faster than I can.
This is amazing.
This reminds me of home.
He looks just like his mother.
He learned to swim.
Stop!
I owe a lot of money.
I often hiccup.
This town hasn't changed much in the last ten years.
Facebook is boring.
Do you play in a band?
Don't answer that.
I'm going to my uncle's this week.
Tom often eats popcorn when he's watching a movie.
I've never cared about such things.
Please tell me how to get to the airport.
You need to be more careful from now on.
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday.
I hate that color.
We're turning back.
Don't worry about a thing.
I was careful.
I'm open to suggestions.
The horse is thirsty.
He gave me a watch.
Why don't you start by telling us what you saw?
They are eating their apples.
I know a lot about environmental problems.
"Sing us a song, please."
I don't like it when you swear.
What exactly is that?
I'm busy all the time.
You did not come to school yesterday.
His comments about the book were favorable.
I have something else in mind.
They're playing our song.
I'm longing to see him.
We should call the police.
What time are you coming back?
Do it tomorrow.
The food was so good that I ate too much.
This train is bound for New York.
Did you pay for the book?
"If you're happy, I'm glad."
You're restless.
It was no accident.
Your father was right.
This book is too expensive.
Tom can't tie his own shoes.
I should get back home.
They rejected our idea.
I have no food.
Evil always wins.
I wasn't scared at all.
I sure wish you would leave.
I can't slow down.
Perhaps Tom can help you find a job.
I don't speak French.
Are you afraid of me?
I'm here with a friend.
"I'd like a receipt, please."
I was naive.
Your boyfriend looks cute.
I decided to come to Japan last year.
She's eating for two.
Tom is older than Mary.
Tom is determined to help Mary.
I don't know you.
Who invited you to the party?
I hardly see you anymore.
The odds are in his favor.
I bought Tom a hot dog.
He should thank me.
Forget it. It's too risky.
There were lots of people.
We need an answer.
It can not be true.
"I'm sorry, I don't speak French."
"If you see a mistake, then please correct it."
She divorced her husband.
It is fun to swim in the sea.
This is for my friend.
Tom can't be older than Mary.
She was afraid to make a speech.
We have tried everything.
I said I'm fine.
Stop talking about Tom.
The worst is already over.
Should I reply?
Are you getting enough oxygen?
Prices went up.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
It's outdated.
She advised him not to drive too fast.
They're cool.
Let me think a minute.
You don't know the system.
"Don't call the cops, man."
Do you mind if I take a day off?
I realized I couldn't win.
My brother smokes a great deal.
Don't let me down.
You have no right to pass judgement on these people.
That small star is brightest.
Who does this belong to?
The doctor started to examine her.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt."
Tom never really wanted to go to Harvard.
"He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party."
He donated countless pieces to the museum.
Get back to the ship.
I have to do my best.
We haven't seen you in a while.
That no longer matters.
Bring along your friend.
He can be proud of his father.
The same is true of all human beings.
Which is the more expensive of the two?
"Above all, don't forget to write me."
The way she talks gets on my nerves.
He looks suspicious.
What was it?
He admitted that he was wrong.
"If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it."
Was I really boring?
I've often seen him bullied.
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
Tom called his wife to say he'd be late.
"To put it bluntly, he's mistaken."
He did it again.
I don't owe him anything.
I tried to save you.
She visited him on October 20th.
Did you see what I did?
What's the most fun you've ever had?
She had nothing to do yesterday.
"After three drinks, the man passed out."
I can't believe I let you talk me into volunteering.
It gets better.
What is it you do?
You don't have to go.
You should begin with easier questions.
We've got bigger problems.
He is busy preparing for the trip.
I slept very well.
We invite you to listen to us again.
"Are they coming, too?"
Tom is really ambitious.
He died a few days later.
"Guys, it's my time to go away."
Do you think it'll fit?
I asked who he was.
I have to finish what I started.
It's extremely dangerous.
We were worried about you.
I bear no grudge against you.
I feel like I've been reborn.
You're too loud.
I need to make an appointment.
I'm not like the rest of these guys.
He doesn't like to eat fish.
I don't want to get my clothes dirty.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
I saw Tom and Mary talking to each other this morning.
He'll return at six.
Have they spotted you?
Maybe you were right.
He bore a grudge against me.
They were all smiling.
How many kids do you have?
I don't ordinarily do this.
What happened at that intersection?
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
I have only one sister.
Is there any difference between your idea and hers?
I couldn't let you do that.
I'm not that lucky.
I can't budge it.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
Let me help.
I'm watching you.
The dog is under the table.
I hope you have a good trip.
He is my best friend.
When are you coming back?
I think it's a brilliant idea.
This rug was made without the use of child labor.
"I know you're busy, too."
I want you to go back.
You must be careful with the wine glass.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
Children are our future.
I am concerned for her safety.
I have a hunch that it will rain.
Those photos are hers.
I thought we had a great relationship.
We're old friends.
How long are you going to stay in Japan?
The red lines on the map represent railway lines.
Tom wants to talk to you.
You need to come home.
They dealt with the prisoners kindly.
The soldiers laughed.
I really need the money.
"When he saw me, he started running."
He will succeed without fail.
Don't tell me to go home.
Didn't I tell you so?
You don't even know why I'm here.
"Last summer, I spent three weeks in Boston."
Where would you like to go?
I don't want to talk to you about this.
You don't have to apologize.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
She snuck out the house without him knowing.
I'm just stating the facts.
You can go to the station by bus.
I don't remember you asking me to do that.
She was accused of having lied about the affair.
You gave me only fifty cents.
He will be my deputy while I am away.
You know the drill.
We're managing.
I thought I'd never hear that.
Winter is right around the corner.
Tom went back to his bedroom.
Was your family with you last month?
You're very timid.
Let's do this first of all.
It's not what we want.
Tom is always very aggressive.
The budget must be balanced.
It was raining around Chicago.
Is anyone else going?
She smiled and said goodbye.
That would be a really good idea.
Italian isn't difficult.
I simply wanted to see what was going on.
I didn't like that.
You are entitled to your opinion.
We took lots of pictures.
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
You're never too old to learn.
The crowd applauded.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
He solved the problem with ease.
We're going out.
I had too much to drink last night.
She wriggled her toes.
How long will it take me to finish my homework?
Tom isn't good at hiding his emotions.
Are things going well?
I live in Kobe.
We were very tired from the five-hour trip.
You must be homesick.
How did you get into Harvard?
I got home a little late last night.
I'd say you're jealous.
We have to acknowledge that.
I apologize for that.
Her home is in the suburbs.
You've got to wake up.
He never goes out after dark.
You'll never want what they want.
It's all behind you now.
Are they friends?
I've gotten used to living alone.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you."
You can't both be right.
His wife's a friend of mine.
You can stay only if you are quiet.
He reached across the table and shook my hand.
Tom went back into his office.
Please let me know if it hurts.
Let's do this as quickly as possible.
That kiss was amazing.
I just needed a minute.
She didn't show up.
He showed his photograph album to me.
Physics is my favorite subject.
Is there a timetable?
Are they Canadian?
Could you do that?
You're incredibly talented.
It's not a game.
I shrugged my shoulders.
I don't know what else we should do.
Almost all the students like English.
Didn't you know that?
I like your scarf.
Do you have any money?
He is proud that his father was a famous scientist.
"At last, they came to a decision."
We have enough money.
They don't know what they are missing.
I wish you did not have so many problems.
We have another ten miles to walk before sunset.
Tom can be relied on.
Let us do our job.
Can you please look the other way?
A rabbit has long ears and a short tail.
Shut up!
Leave our house.
I rewrote it.
I'd do it again.
"If Tom wants to leave, he can."
Come see me if you are free tonight.
No one can move the big box.
When did you arrive in Boston?
"You both want the same thing, right?"
"You ask a lot of questions, don't you?"
Could I please use your phone?
Tom didn't laugh.
It is easy for me to answer the question.
Something happened.
We spent too much for this.
We have two daughters.
You don't seem so smart.
Someone coughed.
I can't do that yet.
He made a speedy recovery.
"You are tired, aren't you?"
We drank a lot.
I'm saving money for a car.
You're still green.
You think you're funny?
It's for my science project.
You shouldn't cancel the meeting.
Everyone's someplace else.
Strong winds stripped the tree of its leaves.
Don't be so outraged.
"This is my book, not yours."
Do you study French every day?
He is thirty years old.
I don't like this weather.
I'll always remember you.
I didn't try to go any further.
The students burned their textbooks.
We're so proud of you!
We can't say any more at this time.
He abused my confidence.
Don't be afraid.
I'm tougher than you think.
Why did he do such a thing?
I can do it.
I wanted to laugh.
Are you still mad at me?
This is impossible for me.
People from Madrid are weird.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
A new museum is being built in the center of the city.
Please look for it.
It was a nice party.
The train is bound for Niigata.
We are anxious about our daughter's health.
It's a world record.
That shouldn't be hard for you.
The paint hasn't dried yet.
Tom went outside to smoke a cigarette.
That seems clear.
I've got to speak to you.
He was still alive when the rescue party arrived.
She asked me to pass her the salt.
Was that a yes?
Tom had to run.
We seized the town after a short battle.
I'd like to graduate next spring.
"You were hurt, weren't you?"
They hoped for even better days to come.
Things are not that simple.
Stop crying like a little girl.
Please write down your contact address here.
He believes in the existence of ghosts.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
I finally found a use for this old thing.
How much am I paying you?
We had to stop.
I have no wish to see the man again.
Everything is all arranged.
I really don't think that'll be necessary.
Help me out.
What does silence sound like?
Tom didn't die in vain.
I don't have any time to watch TV.
The wind has died down.
Have you already spent the money Tom gave you?
I love the outfit you're wearing.
I dealt with it.
He's known for that.
It's not every day you get a building named after you.
Do you like Moscow?
My approach is different.
It's a very small price for such an important victory.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
"If you don't want me to go, I won't."
She will soon clear away these dishes.
Are you still planning to quit your job?
I think you're right.
I'd be delighted.
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
You're incredibly talented.
The robber aimed his gun at the clerk.
When do we start?
I think you might be overreacting.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
I found the picture you were looking for.
Inhabitants were not permitted to enter the area.
They sang in chorus.
You're weird.
It's very good.
I wish I had more time to spend with friends.
I like your dog.
She disguised herself as him.
Were you playing tennis yesterday morning?
Stay and have a cup of coffee with me.
Participants in a seance try to contact the dead.
He is used to talking to foreigners.
He mailed a letter home.
You've already given me enough money.
Are you sure you can handle this?
We'll pay for it.
What do you do on Sundays?
She pretended to be a student.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
"Mom, could you read me a bedtime story?"
May I introduce myself?
These are bad times.
This sentence seems to be grammatically correct.
I'm glad you liked my friends.
You cooked the steak just the way I like it.
Do you want this shirt?
I didn't break it.
Why are they leaving?
Can he speak English?
The birds were hungry.
What makes you think that I'm against that?
You're either with me or you're against me.
He can't afford to get married.
I learned to cook from my mother.
The meeting was all but over.
He won't live more than one day.
It is easy for me to solve the problem.
I really don't envy you.
Please sit down!
Tom is always working.
We'll drive.
Are these bananas ripe?
Go kiss someone else.
They followed you here.
Charity begins at home.
It's always worth a try.
You've already forgotten.
She avoided him whenever possible.
I just didn't want to upset you.
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
I've been debating whether I should mention it or not.
We'd like to have some wine.
It's redundant.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
He will travel abroad next year.
I think it's time for me to call it quits.
You're too polite.
Christmas is coming.
Why is this happening?
How did you come by this painting?
She got a present from her boyfriend.
How did you get here so fast?
He has good judgement for his age.
I won't negotiate.
Years of farm work have hardened his body.
You must find work.
Let's sit here on the grass.
The following images are not for the faint of heart.
We eat soup with a spoon.
How do you account for that?
Wait a while.
Have you seen my son?
Am I disturbing something?
I'd like you to keep this a secret.
He goes swimming in the river every day.
It's very cold.
This is not my ticket.
I would lodge a complaint.
I think you've been fortunate.
Are you happy with that?
He's ready to go.
This is outrageous.
It's strange that our friends are not here.
I consider you one of my closest friends.
You didn't miss the meeting.
I received a letter from one of my friends in Japan.
I enjoyed myself a lot.
I want you to go upstairs.
Whoever comes will be welcomed.
We should probably tell Tom.
Why did you accept this assignment?
Here comes Tom.
This job is killing me.
Show us what you've got.
Many lost their homes in the earthquake.
You must do it yourself.
"You are a good cook, aren't you?"
Let's try to clear up this misunderstanding.
Everything is connected.
I cooked dinner.
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
It sounds very strange to me.
I'll call you at seven.
I'd like to hear you play the piano.
Tom was acquitted for lack of evidence.
The students sat in a circle.
He knows every inch of this area.
Trying to do such a thing is a waste of time.
You're all invited.
Are you guys stupid or something?
How much thinner do you want to be?
How's the weather?
Do I have to leave a deposit?
I had a headache.
Will you help me look for my purse?
My dream is to travel in a space shuttle.
His novels also appear in English and French.
"You're busy today, aren't you?"
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
I knew Tom would sing that song.
Shall we take a taxi?
"After an absence of seven years, I went home."
She removed the papers from the desk.
"He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party."
I don't have a family.
The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food.
I like to run.
Your zipper is open.
"I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed."
Don't you like swimming?
I made breakfast.
I know what they mean.
You are good.
That could come in handy.
His story moved her to tears.
You made a good decision.
Could you turn the volume down?
Will you please put the baby to bed?
I love your eyes.
Dinner is probably ready by now.
Tom knows the man Mary came with.
He's a freelance journalist.
He'll rip my head off.
You ought not to stay up so late.
"I don't like it, either."
I will go if you go.
Excuse me.
I will pick him up at the station.
Do you want your coat back?
They remained good friends.
I wish I could buy that guitar.
She guessed right.
I can attest to everything she just said.
We swam in the lake.
You're such a jerk.
"No matter who says so, I can't believe that."
I went to get vaccinated.
I was forced to do it.
He is earning twice my salary.
Why did you come home so late?
I am fond of music.
Everybody's in position.
Put your pants on.
I will give you the money tomorrow.
Tom doesn't often do his homework before dinner.
You're not bad.
Why would you ask that?
I'm dieting.
He left Japan never to come back.
I need you to fix this.
I'll be singing a song at Tom and Mary's wedding.
We've done a lot.
You didn't need to hurry.
He has no bicycle.
Did I ask your opinion?
Bring your student ID!
"You don't hear me complaining, do you?"
She watched him continue to fight as hard as he could.
Tom told Mary to keep that a secret.
I thought they wouldn't like you.
He was among those chosen.
Do you want us to take you with us?
Please give us some examples.
Tom went into the kitchen to get some coffee.
His wife goes with him wherever he goes.
I did everything I could think of.
Tom explained why he was there.
How do they expect us to survive?
She speaks a little Arabic.
School is a waste of time.
He was afraid of the dark.
I was really mad at myself.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't cheat.
"We did have fun together, didn't we?"
I had a good time at the party.
That sounds too good to be true.
We need to keep this confidential.
They say he's sick.
Don't change a thing.
I thought you wanted to come with us.
Tom said he didn't know how to swim very well.
I need to make a few calls.
He is a man of great ability.
I don't really have a choice.
Why did you do this to me?
I need to see you in my office.
Tom bought a very good camera.
How long ago did the bus leave?
I think you might need me.
Don't ask such hard questions.
Do you know what color she likes?
"I was born on April 3, 1950."
Where did you find that strange thing?
I can't control it.
Do you have many friends?
It rained during the night.
She found him standing near the entrance.
I predicted it.
He can come.
I ran for mayor.
Please sign on the dotted line.
I know who painted this picture.
"Red wine, please."
Didn't you hear your name called?
She's older than Tom.
The sound woke me up.
What do you think I should write?
They were responsible for the accident.
He showed me the way to the store.
He will play tennis tomorrow.
He could not find what I had hidden.
That's what you all say.
I should be there.
He could read me like an open book.
I don't know where you work.
Don't state the obvious.
I'll ask around.
Tell us all the gossip.
Is Tom around?
Tom broke up with me.
"We've got a situation here, you know."
Both of them looked scared.
She gave him a piece of paper.
Why are you so tired?
I want to sleep a little longer.
We've been warned.
My son loves rockets.
You don't have to do it immediately.
She had gone to bed.
Who are we competing against?
I never imagined I'd be working for you.
"As a boy, he would go to the seaside every summer."
Are you aware of what's happened?
Mary is being careful with her baby.
"Something did happen, didn't it?"
Have you lost your ticket?
I'm going to do some reading.
You are the only one who can help me.
They look confused.
He got ready for departure.
Where did you get this key?
Tom is going to enjoy it.
I have lost face completely.
She went with him to Boston.
I really am glad you're here.
My camera can shoot high-definition video.
Tom doesn't think it will snow this afternoon.
You don't have to go.
Hang on!
You look like a kid.
It's better to err on the side of caution.
You must get off at the next station.
You might not want to mention that.
He's in grave danger.
It's still too early to tell.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
Just a moment. I haven't made up my mind yet.
I usually drink a lot of milk.
What do you want to drink with your meal?
What ship were you on?
Was that a squirrel?
Please give me a break.
My cousin is hooked on smack.
Tell me what really happened.
Are you vegetarian?
They live next door.
I was called on in English class.
I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
I don't think it's important.
I like being with you.
I want to know what you think.
He wrote about plants and trees.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Leave a message.
Where shall we begin?
I wish you had come with us.
She answered in tears.
Where's the rest of the money?
I've got some very good news.
I wish you could stay the night.
I've taken care of that.
I must concentrate.
What do you really mean?
You're very rude.
She always prides herself on her academic background.
I suddenly became dizzy.
My best friend is in Rome now.
It's now your turn.
Tom enjoys telling jokes.
Why would anybody eat pickled cabbage?
Don't worry about the results.
I'll meet you at the bus station.
That's a shame.
Are you from here?
The book fell to the floor.
I'm very fat.
I take everything back.
The town was destroyed by the flood after the storm.
He robbed me blind.
"If there's anything else you need, just let me know."
He forgot his promise to go there.
Don't say a word to me.
We're all agreed on that.
I owe what I am to my father.
I'm not allowed to help you.
Leave me alone!
I would've liked to stay longer.
They felt sure of success.
You do your part and I'll do the rest.
The patient fainted at the sight of blood.
The painting won't be sold.
Nobody cares who you are.
You'll have a rough time.
I can't stand this stomachache.
Turn up the volume.
Can you ride a bicycle?
He's waiting for you at home.
Were you happy?
Where can we meet?
I want to press charges.
I got dumped.
I don't know why Tom hates me so much.
I had an asthma attack.
I guess that's OK.
This dog is big.
He can't read it.
Welcome back.
Get it out of the house.
I intended to start at once.
Have they spotted you?
You remind me of someone I used to know.
I always drive at a moderate speed.
That must've been frustrating.
I told them everything.
Everything's very cheap.
Large amounts of money were spent on the new bridge.
Don't you know his name?
She wants to attend the party.
I'm more than happy.
The news can't be true.
How about tomorrow?
Tom complained that he had too much homework.
The police detained several suspects for questioning.
Cabbage can be eaten raw.
The terrorists released the hostages.
It seems that you are not having a good time here.
We'll protect you.
I don't even want to know who you are.
I contacted my parents.
I'm very sorry I came home so late.
I'm one of your students.
People like him because of his friendliness.
Two doctors were talking shop.
Tom was arrested as a suspect in a criminal case.
Tom doesn't smoke.
No one will talk.
I didn't think it would matter.
Tom tied the canoe to the top of his car.
You only have to follow the instructions.
God sent a sign.
They addressed me as doctor.
They used truth serum.
Who built it?
You're a liar.
You are not to leave this room.
You are twice as strong as I am.
She loved him with all her heart.
It's a bit extreme.
He was my best friend in high school.
I'm sorry that you didn't sleep well.
Are you mentally ill?
Study hard.
I always walk.
Hold the box with both hands.
Are you avoiding me?
I come here as often as I can.
How did you make a living in Tokyo?
Thank you for listening to my presentation.
Many atrocities were committed during the war.
That's nonsense.
It's almost impossible.
Mary likes milk very much.
This is how I did it.
Are you interested in foreign languages?
We grow wheat here.
"You're a very sensitive guy, aren't you?"
I'm not crying.
I saw land in the distance.
Why are you looking so sad?
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
It may rain at any moment.
I can't believe you lied to me.
We need more time.
They don't like to do that.
I'm rather surprised to hear it.
His finances have changed for the better.
It's a lot different now.
Tom borrowed my ruler.
I agree with your opinion.
I will study German.
"If you need more information, we are happy to send it."
She met her uncle.
We're going north.
Is Tom related to Mary?
He had no luck in finding work.
I gave my brother a dictionary.
I don't know how to handle this.
You have little to gain and much to lose.
You can come to visit us anytime you want.
There's nothing there.
The kids are making too much noise.
Are you sure of it?
He gave me a ride home.
It is dark in that room.
My mother does not always get up early.
I feel more confident now.
Tom looked back.
I'm bad at sports.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
Do you hear me?
What an attractive woman!
They have already finished the work.
I saw him wash the car.
He is a diplomat at the American Embassy.
We're among friends.
I love Chinese food.
Why are you so secretive?
Please come this way.
Tom became a national hero.
He's better at it than I am.
He is eager to go to China.
I'm sure Tom will be home soon.
He was a general in the Second World War.
I'm not that bad.
I wish you'd trust me.
I talked with her for an hour.
They talk all the time.
He demanded that his salary be increased.
I'm going to work.
Tom thinks we should leave early.
I smell bacon.
It was a mess.
Deal us the cards.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
Why won't you look at me?
The bird spread its wings.
Her hair is very short.
I don't know if I can make it without you.
We spent our holiday exploring rural France.
I'd like to live in the suburbs of Kobe.
Why did you make such a mistake?
I would rather have a coffee.
They don't know me there.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
I did not know this.
Do you want to come in?
He was voted prom king.
Tom's funeral will be this weekend.
I didn't want to spend any more time alone.
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
This is the book that I told you about.
He got what he wanted.
Are we alone?
"Quite by chance, I met my old friend in the airport."
This is a book of children's stories.
He admitted his defeat.
Quit acting like a child.
You are very dear to me.
She sang pretty well.
"If you can't beat them, join them."
"If you need a ride, I could come and get you."
"If I were caught, do you know what would happen?"
I didn't try to go any further.
Do you carry weapons?
Did you understand me?
I don't know why I was so nervous.
Do you think I'm pretty?
It is not necessary for you to quit the job.
Tom denied that he had stolen anything.
You're wasting your time trying to convince Tom.
He was caught in an ambush.
I'm still intimidated by you.
Can you make yourself understood in Japanese?
What have you come up with?
Where can I get a telephone card?
I'm still thinking about it.
Tom showed Mary the ropes.
I've got to get dressed for school.
Their habitat is threatened by deforestation.
I'm not studying French.
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen.
I was very exhausted.
I want to make sure that doesn't happen.
Let's examine the numbers.
Everyone was doing it.
We were impressed.
I'll take anything.
Do you understand what's going on?
Is it yours?
He is to come here at six o'clock.
Miyazaki is not what it used to be.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
I can't do without your advice.
He must be a good boy.
Tom asked Mary to go out to have dinner with him.
I have no books to read.
What you need is a friend.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Tom doesn't know the whole story.
Don't be so pessimistic.
You are the only one who can help me.
We've been unable to determine the cause.
It took a whole month to break in those new shoes.
I'm out of breath after running up the stairs.
Everything is going fine.
We know you're interested.
I don't want to think about what could have happened.
They are still children.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
You have my sympathies.
I like summer the best.
"Tom might've fooled you, but he won't fool me."
I got rid of it.
Are you sure that's necessary?
We are pretty much in agreement.
I want you to explain it to me in more detail.
Why would Tom be here?
There used to be a bridge here.
I want to know where you heard that.
You're really selfish.
I want to see for myself.
Gum got stuck to the bottom of my shoe.
What did Tom tell you about that?
She came alone.
"Never mind, I can do it by myself."
I suppose you are right.
He is sick.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
He has only a superficial knowledge of the subject.
Japanese is my mother tongue.
"We climbed up the mountain, but with difficulty."
"No matter how he tried, he could not open the door."
You have to work harder to make up for lost time.
Just do it.
I'm usually not this busy.
I'm unbiased.
Tom died when he was 97.
Have a nice day!
"Tom doesn't speak French, does he?"
I don't recall you saying anything about that.
I hadn't thought of that.
We were all so busy then.
"You're sure about this, right?"
I can't find anything.
We are all set.
It's not brain surgery.
Do you want to play with Tom?
How much more suffering can they endure?
Quit acting like a baby.
That's not how you spell my name.
He knows how to drive a car.
Why did you buy the flowers?
I want to thank you for your time.
I don't think we want to go down that road.
They were motivated by revenge.
Please help Tom.
I wonder how all of this happened.
Tom persuaded Mary to go to the party with him.
The game will be held rain or shine.
"You warned me, but I didn't listen."
I was shaken.
Is he looking?
Many young people in Spain are unemployed.
Adolescents often quarrel with their parents.
"Go on, Tom, I'm listening."
I dropped my earring.
I think Tom has made a mistake.
He tends to get angry when people oppose him.
I ate caviar.
Don't worry about me.
I'd lock my doors if I were you.
You know I don't dance.
They don't even know why.
I'm out of place here.
We should get more organized.
We're all busy.
I think it's wonderful.
I knew you'd enjoy the concert.
Are you through with the newspaper?
You've lost your marbles.
I know that you're vegetarians.
I'll give him a buzz.
The Japanese economy developed rapidly.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
How's married life going?
You won't be shot.
I don't know whose umbrella this is.
A sensible man wouldn't say such a thing in public.
I wonder how long it's going to take.
I had to see it for myself.
Let's ask him.
How did you end up here?
I saw him cross the street.
Bring as many boxes as you can carry.
Don't sleep with the windows open.
It was less than fifteen dollars.
Faith is believing what you know ain't true.
You can't blame him.
I hope you're not alone.
I wrote him to ask why.
"Stop it, please."
I've got to learn some new songs.
A driver was sleeping in the car.
I didn't bring this topic up with her.
Tom knew there was a problem.
Look at these prices.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
He himself did it.
This doesn't seem normal to me.
I'll leave it up to you.
We're having some guests over this evening.
I missed a lot.
We need to take this into account.
The sisters hate each other.
Why is Tom so afraid of Mary?
It blew my mind.
I'd like to improve my French pronunciation.
"Now, what else can I do for you?"
He abandoned the idea.
There's no need to hurry.
Where do we get the textbooks?
Tom seldom wears his black shirt.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
I'm good for now.
Who painted this painting?
You're very understanding.
Have it your own way.
I can come at three.
I apologize if I offended you.
Never mind what happened.
Can you do without an English dictionary?
I think we'll get off at the next station.
Do you feel giving gifts is important?
She went to the museum by taxi.
They're not going to give you this job.
It's characteristic of him to behave like that.
It's not about them.
We don't have any money.
Don't come again.
I've read hundreds of books.
I have everything I need.
What game do you want to play now?
He left immediately.
I don't know what I've been so afraid of.
They accepted each other.
Many people believe that money brings happiness.
He wants to get a new dictionary.
I study English.
I've had a tough year.
No one knows what has become of her.
Read as many books as possible.
I don't know yet what I want to do.
We studied the government's economic policy.
How can you concentrate?
It took us two hours to get to Tokyo.
He seems to be asleep.
I'm still dubious.
Is this one of your creations?
I hate the way the water tastes here.
Where is the toothpaste?
Maybe you could talk to Tom.
You're very funny.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Tom took ski lessons.
I thought that you could swim.
Are you a model?
I have doubts about the success of their plan.
I don't know how you can believe such nonsense.
Why don't you start by telling us where you went?
Was that really worth it?
How many of these things have you made?
We'll get another one.
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
She gave an oral report to her boss.
Has Tom become crazy?
Were you able to sit down?
Tom hid under the bed with the cat.
It is not easy to understand why you want to leave.
What are you going to do with it?
My son always gets sick when he rides a bus.
I think his life is in danger.
Tom saw that movie last summer.
They had a debate on same-sex marriage.
All men must die.
You didn't tell me everything.
You were incompetent.
I doubt that's what really happened.
I wish you could have come with me.
I have visited Paris once.
Tom certainly got the message.
We know him.
She advised him to drink more milk.
Did you get fired from your last job?
Why don't you eat vegetables?
I'm not worried about money.
Tom has back problems.
I do it all the time.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
Tom's mad.
The dog felt guilty about eating the homework.
You don't look that good.
This breaks my heart.
I felt somebody patting on my shoulder from behind.
I like him.
She got him to drive.
My brother sends you his regards.
We don't know her.
Tom wanted me to walk home with him.
He's dating my daughter.
Can you supply me with everything I need?
Ask her what she bought.
I met him once when I was a student.
Please bring the others.
You put in too much pepper.
Tom works in Boston.
I have to talk to you alone.
I haven't thought much about it.
Be careful with that thing.
I am losing my patience with you.
What should I buy?
I just want to be clear.
The meeting was called off.
I'm not gambling anymore.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
What are you called?
I want you to be my friend again.
I'm happy to be back.
Hokkaido is to the north of Honshu.
Tom is a preacher.
What a terrible mistake!
I couldn't stand it any longer.
Tom said that Mary wasn't in Boston.
He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.
He won't leave me alone.
He thinks he's so great.
I want to make that very clear.
I've got to speak to you.
They want to know what your plan is.
I'm used to it.
Tom has a soft voice.
I'll be working.
He is afraid of making mistakes.
His eyes failed him.
The mayor's daughter has been kidnapped.
I feel sick every morning.
Most of this building's tenants are artists.
He went surfing.
Am I not right?
Tom asked me to marry him.
Call a doctor.
I'm a salesperson.
Can they see us?
He burst into laughter.
Please put some candles on the birthday cake.
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
He's a scriptwriter.
Answer me.
"Tom is at school, isn't he?"
We don't have to do this.
What time did you wake up?
A unicycle has only one wheel.
Mary likes helping others.
It was raining yesterday.
She handed me a postcard.
I've managed to persuade Tom to come.
Tom refused to let Mary in the house.
He is a student at Yushu High School.
"Apart from that, I don't know anything."
Is anyone going to eat that?
Tom played his violin.
Everybody loved Tom.
He also saw it.
"You speak French, right?"
We could not overtake him.
The cottage was clean and tidy.
I've already told everybody to go home.
How do you plan on paying for that?
How did you lose it?
Where do they live?
It looks familiar.
They collected shells on the beach.
He does not wear a hat.
She took me by surprise.
What was it that you did there?
He's somewhere in the park.
I told Tom to ignore it.
It's a good question.
I never thought I'd ever get married.
I don't want that kind of responsibility.
Don't talk to anybody about this.
The arrow glanced off the tree.
I was in London most of the summer.
Give me a call tomorrow.
Tom didn't know what else to say.
I promise you I'll look after you.
I wrote that.
You're very emotional.
Does this look familiar to you?
I'm waiting my turn.
Such a person is seldom dull.
It's still snowing.
Her dress was torn.
They want to talk to you a moment.
I had no place else to go.
"Tom asked Mary to do that, so you don't have to."
He is eight.
That really bothers me.
The motor does not function properly.
I still have the key to Tom's house.
It was horrible.
It is very kind of you to invite me.
How can I tell if I'm really in love?
What cold drinks do you have?
I think you're funny.
Tom did it single-handedly.
How could they have done it?
I didn't feel like celebrating.
I have a feeling you might want to see these.
We can't find a good sewing machine anywhere.
I can't help you do that.
My favorite sport is skiing.
I think we should just be friends.
He is proud of his father being rich.
You can do this.
He is very brave.
I serve no one.
They knew exactly what they were doing.
That's not funny.
Keep your hands clean.
I really miss my girlfriend.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
They've just left.
How many have you killed?
Tom has lost another umbrella.
He is a recognized authority on the subject.
You might be correct.
When is a good time for you?
It's a really bad situation.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
Tom has been smiling all day.
Not a star was to be seen.
He speaks English better than me.
I should've put on some sunscreen.
This safe is for keeping valuables.
I woke you up.
Tom has no prior criminal record.
We'll have to postpone the meeting.
"One can't help many, but many can help one."
Stories often have happy endings.
He passed away quite suddenly.
She was in the mood for a walk.
Tom borrowed my car.
"First of all, I must say this."
I will show you some pictures.
We are Australians.
I'm untalented.
He is always looking for praise.
I felt very sleepy.
It's really awesome.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
What time and where could we meet?
The cherry blossoms are at their best.
Riding double on a bicycle is dangerous.
We've made too many bad decisions.
Look what I did.
You can't be too careful.
Will it fit?
He was afraid of his wife.
He lacks common sense.
He is familiar with Japanese culture.
Is it really that hard to speak French?
Tom has been dating Mary for about three years.
Right now I don't have any time.
You never get my jokes.
They really slept on the floor.
I have something to tell you.
Are you still playing the bassoon?
We're separated.
How are things going?
I don't know who else to turn to for help.
Why do you study?
I don't even want to know.
Tom studies French as well.
I'm not English.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
Shut off the water.
I didn't do it for you.
Tom fell down into the ravine.
I asked the stranger what his name was.
He cut down on drinking.
I've never regretted doing that.
Take a little nap on the sofa.
I just want you to listen to me.
Which one of those is yours?
I want you to get me a soda.
I've been way busier than expected.
Japan is not rich in natural resources.
I found the diary that my father kept for 30 years.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
Why do you always do this?
The storm destroyed the whole town.
Are you ambitious?
The dog is panting.
They made equally tough demands.
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
My business is slow right now.
Why don't you let me take a look?
They wouldn't refund my ticket.
My father is always getting angry.
Success does not come from laziness.
Tom writes better than I do.
Let's see if Tom can help.
You need to be more patient.
I just got my first tattoo.
His house is at the foot of Mt. Fuji.
I'd bet my life on it.
I thought you were my friend.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
What do you say you join me for dinner?
Hold still.
Someday my dream will come true.
I dropped my keys.
Where did it come from?
The girl was trembling with fear.
The plan calls for a lot of money.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Please be quiet.
I don't need a wheelchair.
Is it you?
"Go ahead, try it now."
You have no idea how important you are to me.
Have you gone completely insane?
I aimed my gun at the target.
I wish there was more I could've done.
He looked back over his shoulder.
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer.
Please excuse my being late.
Tom says he has no choice.
I am glad to hear the news.
It's high time you were in bed.
She made him a new suit.
He hurt his left hand with a knife.
She offered her seat to an old woman.
He studies history at college.
That is no business of his.
My father has been in good shape since his operation.
It was him that broke the window yesterday.
Can you give me another example?
I'm pleased to see you.
An important quality of steel is its strength.
I share a room with Tom.
You're spoiling the mood.
This is my favorite subject.
I'm glad you're letting me do this.
Tom can do anything he wants.
You'll be asked why you want to be a teacher.
What's that?
Tom is extremely narrow-minded.
Isn't it true?
He made no reply.
Be very careful.
I can't wait for school to start.
Tom is still confident.
I thought you were broke.
I'm not going to let you boss me around.
Tom was afraid that Mary might change her mind.
Do you know what he said?
The food is horrible.
The two teams fought very hard.
"Bartender, I'd like to have a drink."
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
I want you to handle it.
You need to go.
You're very funny.
Someone stole my wallet on the train.
Tom is falling asleep.
I've been promoted.
Will he ever forgive me?
This hat doesn't fit me.
Tell me why I shouldn't fire you.
She has about as many stamps as I do.
I had no idea you'd be here.
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor.
The doorman will call a taxi for us.
Stand back!
We heard something moving in the next room.
See you at lunch.
We're touched.
You can go there.
Where are they swimming?
The statue has no head.
I want revenge.
There are cases where honesty doesn't pay.
Out of my way!
I hope you're well rested.
They walked down the street singing a song.
It was not my intention.
I don't think I can leave early.
I anticipated trouble.
We don't live in a perfect world.
No one is more determined than I am.
He ate rice twice a day for many years.
Tom hates being disturbed when he's studying.
It's completely irrational.
"Fasten your seat belt, please."
How come you didn't call me last night?
Don't be so dramatic.
I would like to go to Japan.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
She did her best never to think of him.
I like jogging.
Everything was very good.
Answer at once when spoken to.
You'll need a temporary bridge.
I don't think that I deserved the punishment I got.
I have no idea what this means.
I looked down.
I understand it.
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
This word comes from Greek.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
I was sick.
"I will go, rain or shine."
Vigorous exercise makes you sweat.
She is just a wallflower.
Fill in this application form and send it at once.
We all need to stay together.
You've had enough.
Is this the reason you didn't want me to come?
He is not as clever as my brother.
Tom doesn't look like a rebel.
He's been teaching for 20 years.
I forgot my email address.
I'm playing with my cat.
"A few years ago, there was a huge scandal."
Tom got quite a few positive responses.
Will you have some more tea?
He did all the legwork.
I didn't know who he was.
You can't park your car here.
I just wanted to make that clear.
Don't worry. We'll get the money.
"Judging from his appearance, he must be a rich man."
Be careful or you'll strip the gears.
I hate them.
Do as you like.
He got all his information from secondary sources.
You're pulling my leg.
Are you still scared?
I forgot to pay for the drinks.
She left home after three days.
She loves watching tennis matches on TV.
Tom has a driver's license.
How was your meeting?
He made a bad decision.
"In case of an emergency, what number should I call?"
I didn't know that Tom was from Boston.
They smiled at each other.
He is impatient to see you.
That'll be enough.
This table is clean.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
Our mother bought us a puppy.
I have something in my suitcase for you.
I'll kill the both of you.
He was banished from the kingdom.
She advised him to stop smoking.
We were all at school together.
You should lower your standards.
How curious!
There are many people who don't like me.
It doesn't bother me to walk in the rain.
"I know you see it, but are you really looking at it?"
"You can swim, can't you?"
My father will often read the newspaper during meals.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
I'm resourceful.
I think they like you.
Don't buy me any more presents.
"I don't know how you did it, but you did it."
She is doing her homework now.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
He stuck to his promise.
I loved watching you dance.
"We've learned a lot, too."
Tom cheats.
Am I in trouble financially?
Do I have your permission to do so?
They love coffee.
Now the mountain is hidden by the clouds.
She didn't want him to play poker.
This bed is cold.
You've told me that joke before.
That will please my father.
How do you think you'd look wearing that dress?
A child needs love.
Let me check your ticket.
The telephone is red.
"They welcomed me warmly, so I felt at home."
Please leave a message.
I need to go home.
Are cats smarter than dogs?
The American flag has fifty stars.
Tom has a big TV.
Tom doesn't do much.
I'd love to come back next week.
"I must pass this exam, no matter what."
Don't tell your dad.
I can't stand it anymore.
"You wanted this, didn't you?"
We're like brothers.
You seem to be an honest man.
I think she made up that story.
Would you like something smaller?
I wish I could stay longer.
Tom got into trouble because of Mary.
I've tried everything I know to cheer him up.
"Tom is obese, isn't he?"
She gave him a few pointers on pronunciation.
Have you met anyone yet?
You aren't invited.
I want to see you first.
I think Tom will like this game.
I know that this is important to you.
They climbed to the top of a cliff.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
Could I have the check?
Could you drop me off at the library?
I am the leader of this team.
One is never too old to learn.
I want Tom to read this.
He touched me.
I knew you'd come back to me.
We were hoping something interesting would happen.
I left the room.
You're not allowed in here.
Did you buy a new phone?
Tom has decided to stay.
Who left this mess in the toilet?
"Thank you, sir, for your kindness."
"You were afraid, weren't you?"
You will need an armed escort.
It's stealing.
I never thought you'd become a doctor.
"Judging from his expression, he is in a bad mood."
The party is in full swing.
Are you out of your mind?
I must give Tom that.
He gets a kick out of reckless driving.
You'll get over this.
It's easy to make and it's cheap.
You should go on a diet.
Steel traps are illegal.
How much for half a kilo?
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I decided on telling her of my love.
How could you be so cruel?
"""When do you watch TV?"" ""I watch TV after dinner."""
Tom is the tallest boy on our football team.
He sneaked around to the back door.
He and I are in the same class.
Have you prepared everything for tomorrow?
I'm going to miss you a lot.
I owe my success to her help.
Who's speaking?
I caught a glimpse of her face.
I should've known it was you.
"Shut the door, please."
It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella.
I was warned.
You must think of your family.
"I'm sorry, I don't buzz in people I don't know."
Did you have a good time yesterday?
I will not let you do it.
She taught French in Italy before moving to Paris.
I hate them all.
Would you mind leaving us alone for a few minutes?

"I want to play, too."
The Congress had no money.
How do you use this camera?
He is a novelist and artist.
We've already sent a message to Tom.
Do we know you?
I'm a night owl.
You don't look Japanese.
Who are you talking about?
He is worthy of our praise.
Don't run.
I never win.
I had the exact same feeling.
I have been waiting for almost half an hour.
I don't know what it is.
He surprised his opponent.
I didn't want to postpone our meeting.
You must not behave like this.
He thinks that they are not sentient beings.
He doesn't tan.
We must fix this.
My homeroom teacher is Mrs. Jackson.
Do you have any allergies?
I want to help you with your homework.

They could only listen.
The boat sank in a flash.
We were beaten.
She spends most of her money on clothes.
Tom put a flea collar on his dog.
You should have done so.

Try to make good use of your spare time.
I want a room with two beds.
They're all liars.
Living here isn't easy.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
He is putting on weight.
It was a mistake.
I'll have a talk with Tom.
You're naive.
The cat is not dead.
You may leave your bag here.
Will you go to the dance with me?
I knew this was a mistake.
Tom is always breaking things.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Do you know the man staring at you?
Tom had a difficult job.
Get there early.
I thought you liked it here.
I don't think I ordered that.
I lit the candles.
We both love you.
Are you a criminal?
Look out for rock slides.
He asked me out on a date.
May I borrow your bicycle?
I just want to ask you a question.
That's stupid.
There is little hope that she will come on time.
You're not thinking clearly.
They worshiped him as a hero.
I'd like to speak to the manager.
I'll sue you.
I handed the mike to him.
I feel like I haven't slept for days.
What do you think of the new teacher?
Did you learn to swim when you were a child?
I don't need your help anymore.
I'm ready for a break.

You're awesome.
The administration makes important decisions.
The beaches are better here.

Which sport do you like the most?
I'm all for your suggestion.

You can easily find the bank.
My children like to sing in the car.
He wants to go to the United States.

I'm happy to see you in one piece.
She parked her car in a vacant lot.
You are not supposed to smoke here.
Our visitors are sitting in the living room.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
Is anybody in there?
We went to see our neighbors.
Tom loved it.
Here's what I think.
Do it by yourself.
Just turn this handle.
Let's get back to work.
I can't let them catch you.
I'm glad you were able to meet Tom.
I work at the embassy.
She altered her plans.
How good is he?
I don't need a girlfriend.
"She broke the cup, too."
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
This book is really old.

It's a very good question.
Do you want me to handle this?

You are my friend.
Can you tell us what Tom did?
He drove to school.
His aunt takes care of his dog during the day.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
I want to show you something in the office.
Which is your luggage?
I know you did this.
Let's hurry up.
You or I will be chosen.
"I'm sorry, I don't speak French."
There's someone hiding in the closet.
The bar is closed.
"You don't want to get me in trouble, do you?"
Thanks for coming.
I won't be here that long.
I didn't say it wasn't OK to eat.
Wait until tomorrow.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
"Not knowing what to say, I kept silent."
Don't you think the dog is smart?
"Hurry up, or you will miss the train."
Do you want me to leave?
You can reach me at the address written here.
You don't sound very optimistic.
This is a time of rejoicing.
"You don't expect me to face Tom alone, do you?"
I can't explain it to you now.
What a remarkable performance!
I persuaded him into accepting the offer.
It was almost noon when I woke up.
He lives somewhere around the park.
Is it that obvious?
He is not an American.
You can't just walk in here.
I thought you were trying to be funny.

"I worked hard all day, so I was very tired."
How many men are guarding Tom?
I seem to have a fever.
I'll apologize later.
Ten years have passed since he died.
"He peeked inside, afraid of what he would find."
Who do you think came to see me yesterday?
I miss college.
Do you want to do this later?
The rain lasted for three days.
That person is like me.
I will have lived here for ten years next month.
He is already here.

I did this for my son.

When can I see you again?
I am taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.
Wait a second.
Tom looked a bit puzzled.
Tom is sleeping like a baby.
Tom can speak French fluently.
Look around you.
She made me hurry.
I was sorry.
There's still a lot to be done.

"In a word, life is short."
Bread is made from wheat.
Make sure you don't let the dog outside.

I need time.

Why is that so funny?
You both did well.
We were all disgusted.
Maybe Tom isn't as stupid as he looks.
He acts like he knows everything.
How's the party going?
Did Tom get hurt in the accident yesterday?
How do I turn this off?
My dream is to make it as an actor in Hollywood.

I'll get in.
We can't do such a thing.

What did you do at school today?
I kind of expected you to come alone.

Go on.
It's already past your bedtime.
What's the bottom line?
How did you come by all this money?
You're productive.
We met last Thursday.
Why didn't she help you?
It's better than doing nothing.
I want them to be your friends.
Who tried to kill Tom?
Have you ever been married?
Don't scribble here.

Please sign your name on the contract.
That's how it began.
I had intended to go with Tom.
I like learning ancient languages.
We met in a coffee shop near the campus.
The fire started in Tom's room.
Where did you go?
"If it is worth doing, do it well."
I took your umbrella by mistake.
Hold the door.
"If you don't want to do it, you don't have to."
Her heart was throbbing with excitement.
Have you been mistreated?
That man is strong.
"You won't go, will you?"
This television set is heavy.
I know everybody here.
That's all I wanted to hear.
You were both drunk.
Everybody blames you.
Take any two cards you like.
The house is farther on.
Do you want to discuss it?
I envy your good health.
How long were you at school today?
I ruined everything.
I can see just as well as you can.
The man must be insane.
You need to relax.
This bicycle belongs to me.
Tom is looking for someone who speaks French.
Why didn't you come to the party?
I was disappointed.
Where do you get off telling me anything?
She borrowed the book from him.
You're always saying that.
I didn't know where else to go.
She likes being looked at by boys.
"Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking."
They are looking to you for help.
I never thought about it.
Did you hurt yourself?
This is your final warning.
I think you knew my father.
He used a fake I.D.
That may not be necessary.
I am acquainted with the custom.
I guess we're not invited.
Do you know any Greek myths?
That's all Tom said.
"Don't worry, I'm going to help you."
Do you have any kind of alibi?
What do they want to talk about?
I'd better see what's going on.
You're the only one who can help me.
Many sailors can't swim.
I guess I should get home to the missus.
When will you leave?
I don't like spoiled children.

The answer was yes.
She decided not to go.
I have an older brother.
I want to see your mother.
Tom became an engineer.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
"I ran to school, but the bell had already rung."
You were fantastic.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
Come over to our table.
We need to protect ourselves.
Look again.
Put some music on.
The disease spread in several ways.
Do you want me to be happy?
I'm no expert.
I'm surprised to see you.
I promise I will protect you.
That doesn't seem too difficult.
Do you mind if I open the window?
This is unacceptable.
I want to go to Seattle.

Are you afraid of the dark?
Forget I said anything.
He'll never beat me.
How did you come up with that answer?
A childhood illness left her blind.
I don't remember mailing the letter.
A little rest would do us a lot of good.
A burnt child dreads the fire.
We're shocked.
I won't shut up.
Is that an order?
I thought you said you worked here.
You're double-parked.
Have you told anyone about this problem?
Are you seeing anybody?
They look healthy.
I am ready to follow you.
"In any case, I'll have to go there tomorrow."
Go straight ahead.
All you have to do is to wait.
I don't want to listen to you.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
How many of you are going?
You have such beautiful eyes.
I remember what I saw.
"In fact, he loves her."
Let's end this debate.
That's a different story.
I suppose you want me to pay for this.
You can't go against the laws of nature.
Tom isn't my enemy.
That's exactly what Tom thinks.
Young people often make mistakes.
All you have to do is wash the dishes.
I've been gone for a long time.
I don't feel like doing anything today.
Get me a lawyer.
Tom will try to convince Mary to accept your offer.
My sister is a good swimmer.
Give me a drink.
I don't know that word.
This was not supposed to happen.
We prefer to stay here.
How old are your kids?
I had a really good time yesterday.
I'm getting off the train at the next stop.
Don't tell me what to say.
You can't do two things at once.
She is not wrong.
This is my painting.
Pick up your briefcase.
He used the dictionary.
I felt responsible.
Tom told me you were afraid.
I couldn't tell you why.
She's much happier than him.
That's not very original.
You may go anywhere you like.
I tried flying from the top of the tree.
Let me get you the key.
Few people live to be more than a hundred.
I appreciate your support.
I finally found the solution to the problem.
I want to confess.
I swear I will never do such a thing.
I advised him to keep that promise.
Tom sold his car to Mary for three hundred dollars.
Did you understand any of that?
I know that you're very angry.
People have started arming themselves.
He suddenly tightened his arm around her.
How often do you brush your teeth?
He isn't afraid of death.
Can this wait till morning?
She is singing the latest popular songs.
I'll tell you a secret.
What is your job?
Let's go to the hospital.
She took him to the lake.
He asked for more money.
I want you to be my partner.
I wish to speak with you in private.
I don't need that anymore.
I am taking a couple of days off.
I love comic books.
I think it's fine.
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Thank you for your concern.
You'd be the one to know.
I'd rather walk.
I thought everyone was happy.
We should probably postpone the competition.
"Even if it rains, I'll go swimming tomorrow."
Is it your bike?
I don't feel very confident.
What did you say his name was?
You've certainly been busy.
Please show me your notebook.
What are you doing in my room?
My uncle has been diagnosed with leukemia.
You're very sophisticated.
I think your French has improved a lot.
I know that you still think about me.
Who's the author?
He doesn't believe me at all.
There's volcanic ash in the atmosphere.
I waited for him till ten.
Let's go camping.
I'm charmed to meet you.
Why weren't we told the truth?
She should know better at her age.
Get me the details.
That was promising.
There's nothing nefarious going on here.
Do you mind if I get started?
Pork doesn't agree with me.
I chanced to meet him at the airport.
We had so much fun together.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
Do I know Tom?
What're we looking for?
I would never let you down.
We'd better leave him alone.
"Two vanilla ice creams, please."
You had better put on your crash helmet.
They let me go.
"Don't open it, please."
I don't plan on being here that long.
"I am going to my room, where I can study."
Who painted this?
Be realistic!
I've been here all afternoon.
Who would like to go first?
They are the ones who want to go.
He donated countless pieces to the museum.
How can you be so sure of that?
Leave it to the professionals.
I suggest you listen carefully.
This is an extremely serious matter.
I took it for granted that you would come.
I won't do that again.
You are a good person.
Tom forgot to bring a flashlight.
How many students are there in your university?
Nobody believed what I said.
There is not much doubt about the cause of the fire.
They're brothers.
It is cold outside today.
We're retiring.
I'm a lonely man.
This is unexpected.
I have rights.
I can't believe you're trying to bribe me.
The boys in the village laughed at me.
I'll speak to him at the first opportunity.
It's time for you to tell me the whole truth.
Fishing is fun.
Where's my mother?
My uncle was standing there with his arms folded.
This is so crazy.
Man can't live without dreams.
He was clearly embarrassed.
I just heard something.
Have you finished your homework?
She wept with emotion.
I took it for granted that she had received my letter.
Tom didn't accept my apologies.
He has never been abroad.
He is unmarried.
Who is the gentleman he is speaking to?
A big typhoon is approaching.
Can I tempt you to try another piece of cake?
I do hope you will come and visit us soon.
Please excuse me for being rude.
It's a bit too complicated for me.
She stood up.
I know you know this.
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark.
I often travel.
I think that's a great idea.
I love winning.
She glanced briefly at the newspaper.
I found my car missing.
What book did you buy?
I'm ruined.
I'm not familiar with French poets.
Why did you come home so late?
We're all done here.
I'm sure Tom will get mad.
Don't tell anybody.
This sentence is not in English.
"If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry."
Why are you wearing those?
You never know for sure.
Tom says it's an emergency.
Do you know anyone who was on that ship that sunk?
I hope your assignment in England was successful.
Are you really going to let Tom go there by himself?
You're free to go.
I don't want to study today.
He lost his life in an accident.
Where is the mistake?
The Smiths are our neighbors.
I need new tires.
I bought a new bag.
Here is a letter for you.
It is certain that he will come here.
We all sang in unison.
You're better off not getting in his way!
They'll kill me.
His room is untidy.
You're opportunistic.
I beg you to stay.
Stop teasing me.
I think it's very romantic.
He is very stingy with his money.
I think maybe that was my fault.
I suggest that we go out on Friday.
Do you consider them dangerous?
Everyone jumped into the pool.
I want you to speak frankly.
Each of us has to be careful when driving.
You look terrific.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
There was a tape recorder on the table.
Where did you put my keys?
Tom is really busy most of the time.
I'm wondering if I love her.
Would you mind paying this time?
I made him carry the suitcase.
He will do his best to finish it on time.
I won't tolerate it.
I never let anyone else feed my dog.
He is not man to lose heart at a single failure.
He was going to school.
Your dog is very big.
She is not so much a singer as a comedian.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
I will do the shopping for her birthday.
Tom said that Mary wasn't in a hurry.
They love their kids.
I'm starving.
I don't pretend to understand women.
I know what to study.
Are you tired of living?
They were having marriage problems.
Tom calls Mary every night.
I'm not doing that.
We like playing soccer.
I got fined.
What's happened here is a travesty.
Look up the words in your dictionary.
"However hard you try, you can't finish it in a day."
Television helps us widen our knowledge.
Can anyone verify that?
I wasn't that smart in school.
"You were working yesterday afternoon, weren't you?"
What do you think they'll do to me?
Tom thought he was going to die.
I thought you might like some company.
We have the same group of friends.
What exactly are you implying?
I came here to study.
I think it's time for me to retire.
Please be polite.
He found my bicycle.
The rules were recently relaxed.
I need a heavy coat.
"As far as I know, he won't come."
Language changes as human beings do.
I'll never ask you this question again.
Is there central heating in this building?
He gave us not only clothes but some money.
The brain needs a continuous supply of blood.
Those keys aren't mine.
"As time went on, the sky grew darker and darker."
Don't touch the glass.
It's already too late.
I thought that he was honest.
I hate math most of all.
You will not be able to catch the train.
He lives paycheck to paycheck.
That's upsetting.
Tom and Mary got into their car.
She suffers from a contagious disease.
She wasn't dancing with him then.
They got into the train.
The police accused him of theft.
We never lose.
That's why I'm here.
I go to bed at 10.30.
Come on. Give it a try.
He's overconfident.
Tom split up with Mary.
What do you think they want?
Why do you want to do that?
They left.
The plane made a perfect landing.
"In any case, I must finish this work by tomorrow."
What are we going to do?
I assure you Tom will be perfectly safe.
You're not very tidy.
She went to the movies by herself.
Here's your order.
That depends on you.
Take one of these.
It's hard to admit to yourself that you are a failure.
I think you look hot.
I don't have anything new.
We want a new carpet.
Tom is a teenager.
I love the fact that you always seem to care so much.
No problem.
He was not happy about it.
May I make a suggestion?
He made a mistake on purpose.
"You're not a city girl, are you?"
I was momentarily blinded.
I'm not sure I can trust him.
"If you don't trust them, they won't trust you."
We are still clinging to the dreams of our youth.
I wonder if you are truly happy.
We closed the restaurant.
What seems simple to you seems complex to me.
Crows all but destroyed the farmer's field of corn.
How big you are!
The old man looked wise.
What will losing the war mean to us?
I just don't want to let you down.
Where do you want these suitcases?
I have only just begun.
You won't believe this.
How do you think I feel?
It looked awful.
Her face turned white.
You were Tom's only friend.
He complains of not having enough time to read.
You have done very well.
Would you join me for a walk?
I don't want your legal advice.
You're very helpful.
I had a drink or two before you came.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
That's what I have to do.
You're lying now.
This isn't the way to do it.
I didn't know what I should say.
Heat expands most things.
I think it's time for me to say what I really think.
The door handle is broken.
I'm very fortunate.
I've never eaten Chinese food before.
We can win.
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
Expensive meals can't compensate for lack of sleep.
Tell us about your family.
I don't have that information.
I like this.
Don't tell anyone.
All we can do is wait for the police to arrive.
My camera is different from yours.
"Surprisingly, he swims even on cold days."
"You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?"
She hurt her foot when she fell off her bicycle.
I'm afraid I can't.
This noise is annoying.
Tom is too young.
She showed me his album.
She cleaned the house all by herself.
How about your place?
You're faithful.
What book did you buy?
I hope we're not too late.
France is in Western Europe.
Do you want me to leave the light on?
When were you born?
Don't believe him.
Do you find me unattractive?
How much should you exercise?
What're you talking about?
My parents pushed me to quit the baseball club.
"Just at that time, the bus stopped."
This train runs between Tokyo and Osaka.
Hands off.
I learned French in Paris.
He walked across the street.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
The sisters are quite alike.
Why did you open the box?
Our sales are decreasing.
You don't seem convinced.
Central Park is near where I work.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
He's always at home on Mondays.
That patient may die at any time.
You're very stylish.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't like Tom.
This place gives me a really bad vibe.
I don't see what you're so concerned about.
You should not go there.
We can't lose.
I didn't see him.
What kind of wine should I bring?
I go where I'm told to go.
A lot of tourists invaded the island.
I am Italian.
My sister works as a secretary at a bank.
I hope you two are very happy.
Did you telephone him?
This fork is dirty.
I don't know how else to put it.
He's my partner.
I've got someplace I need to be.
Pick a card.
Take the garbage out.
I'm not stopping you.
Don't be upset.
Put your coat back on.
You don't need a list.
I had to work on an essay.
I wasn't interested in the job.
"I'm sleepy, so I am leaving now."
He has been sick in bed all week.
Lock the door.
You two are really kind.
I would like to address two questions.
I plan to do it soon.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
Who owns this house?
Gasoline is no longer a cheap fuel.
I'm too busy to talk to you now.
I can't blame you.
Her doll was run over by a car.
Tom won the contest last year.
I have the minutes of the meeting.
It's not that bad.
I would do it again.
I'll give you a hint.
I recorded the interview.
I'm all set.
He answered my question easily.
Tom waited for Mary for a long time.
I plan to finish it in two or three minutes.
You don't have the nerve.
"You don't know why Tom didn't come yesterday, do you?"
My high school French teacher wasn't a native speaker.
Everyone waited.
It no longer matters.
I hope this isn't a dream.
I do think that Tom is dangerous.
Your things are all here.
They were scolded by the teacher.
It's so clean.
He is a member of the committee.
I think perhaps you should call Tom.
What do you spend a majority of your time doing?
She translated that word for word.
Why are you so tired?
I told you to sign the document.
You can rest.
There must be something else we can do.
I'm astonished by her cleverness.
I'm happy you liked it.
Are you sure?
I beg you to help us.
I guess we're both going to die.
Tom and Mary never listen to me.
We should probably let Tom know what's happened.
You must be cautious.
You're overemotional.
I promise you I won't ever leave you.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
He cannot be saved.
It is a song.
You wouldn't believe it.
Tom didn't go to the hospital.
We're so sorry.
I cannot distinguish a frog from a toad.
I'll have another.
Can you speak English?
Do you like it then?
"Here's looking at you, kid."
Who am I speaking to?
I had an idea.
Wait here till he comes back.
Is eating organic food worth the money?
It's time for our children to go to bed.
The provisions ran out after a short time.
Tom was talkative.
I don't even know where.
How can I contact a Japanese-speaking doctor?
She has three times as many dictionaries as you do.
Tom asked Mary where she had parked the car.
You're safe now.
I apologize for my rudeness.
I think that's the best answer.
I have until tomorrow to finish this.
I don't actually believe that.
This is nothing more than wishful thinking.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
Did you go out?
They are very cheerful.
Would you like one?
I saw them.
I'll be nice.
I was surprised to see so many people at the concert.
How dare you insult my sister!
I'd be devastated.
I'm ready if you are.
Tom looked like he was unhappy.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
Can anyone pronounce this word?
The plane crash was only last week.
Are you sure you don't need my help?
The rumor's all over town.
What sports do you like?
I fear no one.
He employs a maid.
We will win the battle.
I felt cheated.
It's your money.
He hit me on the head.
You can eat whatever you like.
"Whatever you do, don't run."
Tom folded his shirts.
The economy of Japan is still stable.
"When it rains, it pours."
They wear very little clothing.
My father teaches English at a high school.
You can go from Washington to New York by train.
A fight broke out between two schoolboys.
I wish none of this had ever happened.
I was raised right.
I appreciate your taking the time to see me.
I'm not cranky.
You have to get up.
She didn't know what to do.
I appreciate anything you can do.
Just do it.
I could keep it a secret.
I can't sleep when I'm stressed out.
How can you contribute to our organisation?
All you have to do is study harder.
How can you concentrate?
I am going to stay here for a couple of days.
I really like this one.
That's only part of the truth.
I grew up in a poor family.
She practiced typing every day.
The result is neither good nor bad.
Can I borrow this for a while?
I don't know how to pronounce his name.
I'm disgusted and disappointed.
We demand action.
Why pay when you can get it for free?
I've got to do my chores.
You're a good kid.
I think he can get along with his neighbors.
I would like to have a cup of coffee.
It was your idea.
Is he your teacher?
I'll never leave you alone again.
I will teach you how to fish next Sunday.
Everyone is going to be there.
The apprentice is lazy.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint this wall black?
Don't write in library books.
You're not supposed to be in here.
She is fond of cake.
He keeps on asking me for money.
She earns her living by teaching.
I'll go even if it rains heavily.
I caught a big fish yesterday.
I helped out.
I have some stamps in my bag.
"No matter what happens, my determination won't change."
He came running.
Please answer the phone.
What time did you close the store last night?
You're in danger.
It seems that they took the wrong train.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
It is new.
Your honesty is refreshing.
The rain prevented me from going out.
We need to clarify a few details.
We've all been here before.
The funeral is tomorrow.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
She committed suicide yesterday.
I really am glad you're here.
I always make it a point to paint things as they are.
"You'll like it, believe me."
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
I didn't see it.
He has long legs.
There are still a lot of things that have to be done.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
"If you touch that wire, you'll get a shock."
We found Tom's umbrella.
This is not funny.
If only he had been there.
I have my own bedroom at home.
Go away before they see you here.
It's easier to spend a lot than to save a little.
"We did not help him, so he made it by himself."
I think you might eventually change your mind.
You can say whatever you want to.
I don't know what to say about that.
Were you out last night?
The doctor cured her of her disease.
She took advantage of my ignorance.
Tom asked Mary to drive John to the airport.
Dad's always encouraging him.
Hold this.
I'm through.
It's up to you.
Any paper will do.
The ring was nowhere to be found.
Do you have an extra English dictionary by any chance?
"I'm sorry, my father's not here."
Many fish died.
Tom has a lot of French books.
I used a ribbon to tie my hair into a ponytail.
"On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers."
Is that better?
You're not allowed to eat those.
My camera is broken.
I won't say it again.
I want you to be my friend.
I see how you did that.
The shotgun went off.
"Maybe he likes you, too."
This shouldn't take too long.
I want to find a way for us to be happy.
I'm glad for this opportunity to work with you.
How was your afternoon?
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
He held out a helping hand to the poor.
I told you to call me.
How do you say that in French?
Are you telling me you're not involved?
I don't feel much like laughing.
You're extroverted.
The dictator came to power fifteen years ago.
When do you think he'll be back?
I like that it is soft.
Why don't you play something for me?
Do you want some of this?
I used to listen to English programs.
Can't you discount it a little?
I'm so tired that I can't walk any longer.
I have plenty of time.
How do you spell your family name?
We bought a new washing machine.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
Take the garbage out.
Do you drink wine?
Are you making friends here?
This has all been a mistake.
Do you think English is difficult?
I might not come back.
I don't think about you.
I introduced her to you last week.
I want the other one.
She can't find her keys.
How much TV do you watch?
He made good use of the money.
Be still.
No one flinched.
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
I have a job for you.
I grind my own coffee beans every morning.
Where do you work now?
My mother would freak out if she knew about it.
She has never sung a song with him.
Do you think that'll work?
Your problem is you don't study enough.
No one warned me.
"Come on, trust me."
I'll support him.
Go and help wash the dishes.
The top of the mountain is covered in snow.
I just keep finding excuses.
I noticed her hands shaking.
I want to speak to a lawyer.
I didn't understand this joke.
Don't forget your money.
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
The train made a brief stop.
Tom teaches me French.
She is a nurse.
We don't take credit cards.
Can you read this without your glasses?
Didn't you promise never to tell a lie?
Can I eat this cake?
Are you up?
He's raking it in.
Sharpen these knives.
Everyone wins.
He left after me.
We're not welcome.
No one knows what happened.
Thank you in advance for your help.
You can sit down if you want.
It's five o'clock somewhere now.
"Hurry up, and you'll catch the train."
I also use this study for receiving guests.
I would rather you came on Friday than on Thursday.
There are way too many people in this room.
I don't like your attitude.
Do you know any doctors who speak Japanese?
Would you like me to order it?
Why does catnip drive cats nuts?
I accepted the challenge.
I told Tom he made a mistake.
You really are hopeless.
They have access to the library.
He is a very good doctor.
Tom went back to his own room and lay down.
Get it out of the house.
I used to dream about becoming a model.
How did you get here so fast?
All you have to do is try your best.
You aren't as short as I am.
It doesn't matter how much it costs.
We are faced with a host of problems.
Father translated the French document into Japanese.
We watched a movie.
I had nothing to do with it.
Go wash the dishes.
I have no appetite.
They despise you.
That's interesting.
I thought you'd be older.
This camera is very expensive.
Tom has some pretty good ideas.
I didn't know Tom played tennis.
He may have misunderstood you.
I've already made it.
I believe in getting up early.
Tom and Mary both work full time.
He was absolved of all responsibility.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
They're really good at making clothes.
He offered more than could be expected.
I can't imagine it.
"I just think you should be careful, that's all."
How soon are you going shopping?
I like your personality.
Where do we know each other from?
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
You must make up for the loss.
I can't wait all day.
I think I know why you're here.
My bicycle is much newer than yours.
I just do what I'm told.
I forgot to do my homework.
"As soon as he comes back, let me know."
I'm very glad to see you again.
What do firefighters do when there are no fires?
Our country is rich in marine products.
Tom fell over and landed flat on his face.
You need to save the princess.
When do you go on vacation?
How come you're not the boss?
It was cheaper than I thought.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
I didn't get enough sleep.
You should keep your promises.
I should've taken an umbrella with me.
"The company, wholly owned by NTT, is doing well."
I'm a genius.
Paper burns easily.
The clock is ticking.
Did you talk to your wife?
We found a nail stuck in the tire.
I want to hear you play the piano.
I hate to be a nuisance.
You should call your mother more often.
I feel very guilty.
How's it going to happen?
Tom and Mary adopted a handicapped child.
"If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it."
He regrets his mistake.
Why is this website taking so long to load?
That's what makes me nervous.
Would you like to come?
I've never done this before.
Keep away from me.
Smoking will do you a lot of harm.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to drive.
Why does everything happen to me?
She used margarine instead of butter.
I'm needed here.
You should be more careful the next time.
"I go for a walk every day, except when it rains."
I had chicken pox as a kid.
"You want something from me, don't you?"
The meeting finished at nine.
Did you see Tom that night?
I'd like to get started.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
This is risky and dangerous.
This is top secret.
I can't necessarily agree with you on that point.
Tom was clean-shaven.
I let my guard down momentarily.
I have backstage passes.
This is something I must face alone.
The nurse hit a blood vessel.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
You won't be disappointed.
I felt as if I were in a dream.
A detective arrived upon the scene of the crime.
Can you tell what's wrong with it?
I am too tired to run.
I just needed some water.
What nationality is Tom?
Dust off the shelf.
Tom will likely accept your offer.
Don't think about it. Do it.
You can't buy me.
How long are you planning on staying?
He is handsome and clever.
I never get sick of dancing.
They know what happened.
Tom looks extremely busy.
Tom will need to go further.
I want to be an actor.
"No, thank you. I'm full."
It could just be your imagination.
A wonderful idea occurred to me.
It looks like a cow.
What did you talk about?
Let's welcome our guests.
I slept with my clothes on.
You'd better consult the doctor.
Don't worry. I'm good at this.
They did not keep their word.
Were they good?
Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
That sounds like something you would do.
Why did you come here?
My nails are too short.
Tom and Mary are playing a video game.
A heavy snow fell in Kyoto for the first time in ages.
Did I tell you that already?
Where did you get on this bus?
I've known her since I was little.
You are responsible for what you have done.
I have done all that I can.
He asked me if I were happy.
It's time for you to tell me the whole truth.
I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
We're on schedule.
You can make your own.
I need to jump start my car.
She dumped him for a richer man.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
What did you answer?
It's all wrong.
I opened the drawer.
It's not like that.
You and I made a bargain.
I own some very old stamps.
I think you know that's not true.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
I will be waiting for you in my room.
We heard something moving in the next room.
I can't really talk about it.
Your car is fast.
"They had no beards, no hair and no eyebrows."
I am doing my best.
It's being arranged.
Where can I buy stamps?
How often do you shower?
I'm grounded.
Do you want to see my cat?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was innocent.
Tom calls Mary every night.
Is it always cold like this?
He is a bad person.
I see a book.
I feel powerless.
Go home quickly.
It's made of leather.
He came to Berlin as a teacher.
You should get some exercise.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
Tom won a free trip to Australia.
That was great.
They clung together for warmth.
He is crazy about skiing.
I have a test tomorrow.
Don't open the present yet.
"You were hurt, weren't you?"
Why would God allow this to happen?
Could I talk to you in private?
"You don't have to buy water, do you?"
She looked very beautiful in her new dress.
Let me introduce my wife.
I saw Tom in the hallway.
These books are easier than those books.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
Is that supposed to be a question?
But his name is slightly familiar to me.
I want to know who gave that to you.
What's wrong with being nude in your own house?
Tom is at the door. Please ask him in.
She tried to commit suicide.
"You are curious, aren't you?"
The pain is gone.
Why don't you answer?
I like your tie.
I would like to thank you for your collaboration.
I'm pleasantly surprised by that.
They live in constant fear.
You've made your point.
It is said that his father died in a foreign country.
Her parents hate me.
She is afraid of dogs.
He did it the way I told him to.
I'm not here on business.
Get out of bed.
You're naive.
Do you trust anyone?
Birds fly south in the winter.
Excuse me for interrupting you.
Who picked you for this mission?
He's wanted for grand theft auto.
"In any case, it's always my fault."
I'll give you anything but this.
Black looks good on you.
"Boys, don't make any noise."
We are leaving Japan next month.
Stir the paint with a stick.
"Whenever I call, he is out."
I took the little girl by the hand.
We have to acknowledge that.
I had no idea you felt that way.
We're just beginning.
Do you have to do this every time?
I'd like to go somewhere else now.
I want a jump rope with wooden handles.
I'll have to explain that to my father.
You must do it even if you don't want to.
She called him a fool.
"You see that tall building over there, don't you?"
We'll catch you.
I looked for the key.
They admire each other.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
Everyone's dead.
Be more flexible.
I don't mind getting up at six.
What're we looking for?
The risk is too great.
He admitted that it was true.
Wait right here.
We have few opportunities to speak German.
She is always complaining of her job.
Autumn is my favorite season.
The colonists bartered with the natives for fur.
I can't feel at home in a hotel.
She is Japanese.
I know what they are.
She sent him a message.
I love her so much I could die.
Do you think something like that will repeat itself?
My opinion doesn't really matter.
You don't have to be so rude.
"You don't really expect me to tell you, do you?"
No one would've listened.
You can trust him.
She did it carefully.
I'm still studying French.
It's an art more than a science.
Do you want something cold to drink?
I went to the station.
What exactly do you want me to do?
I come from a long line of doctors.
Tom can drive.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
I'll handle the rest.
I hope we achieve that.
"""She likes music."" ""So do I."""
She may not like his attitude.
Draw me a seven-pointed star.
I'm ticklish.
We got too close.
What should I feed my dog?
I'll start with a beer.
"You are tired, aren't you?"
I don't think they're married.
They're mad at you.
I'm twice your age.
"I tried to tell Tom, but he refused to listen."
Are there enough chairs to go around?
Everyone's laughing.
What happened? The car's slowing down.
I know how to drive a car.
My room has two windows.
I'm checking options.
The earth's moon is a natural satellite.
Run for it!
You should exercise.
Why did you buy a flower?
Tom knows he's partly to blame.
Choose whichever you want.
You didn't tell me that you were a doctor.
I am the laziest person I know.
"The next morning, he was gone."
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
My house is near the school.
I didn't know you played the oboe.
I can't find what I want.
I intend to study abroad next year.
I love visiting Boston.
That sounds right.
I felt betrayed.
You're impatient.
He's brighter than they are.
When can I see you next time?
The water was cut off yesterday.
Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
You can't handle it.
I think Tom has been very lucky.
Get out.
You would make a good diplomat.
He invited me to the party.
It won't be hard.
She found a nice tie for me.
She needs some help from us.
They accept students like Tom.
What are we supposed to do now?
I can't believe no one heard that.
She disappeared.
I wonder why Tom left.
We slept in the same bed.
Do you have a twin sister?
I'm all set.
He does not belong in the city.
His parents were furious.
People are playing near the beach.
I think you might want to check this out.
I can't tell you the truth.
A new serial will begin in next month's issue.
Do you want to go tell Tom about this?
Rules are meant to be broken.
I can't believe you just did that.
Should I help them?
I am not the captain of the new team.
Are you still upset about what happened?
I'm a stranger here.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Have you told anyone else about this?
He can't stop laughing.
Trim the fat off the meat.
That is a very good question.
I'm impressed with your French.
What should I tell the kids now?
Tom handed Mary a knife so she could peel the apples.
They deceived us.
I wouldn't have dreamed of it.
Eat your vegetables.
Tom is eager to live in Boston.
Your shoes are wet. Put them near the fire.
There's been a misunderstanding.
We had not gone very far when it started to rain.
We were all on the bus.
You are twice as strong as I am.
A lot has happened.
You ruined my life.
I still love this bicycle.
I was alone in the classroom.
We were unable to follow his logic.
I think we get off at the next stop.
Tom hated his mother.
Mother has old-fashioned ideas.
The animal struggled to get out of the cage.
I doubt that Tom is innocent.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Have you asked if they want one?
Aim. Fire!
It was the best party ever.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Do you have anything non-alcoholic?
There's nothing like a good hot bath.
"If it snows tomorrow, I will build a snowman."
Don't get fat.
Don't make noises when you eat soup.
I built this doghouse by myself.
Tom said that Mary was very unhappy.
I feel safe with you.
Show him how to do this.
"If you want me to play the piano, I'll play the piano."
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Tom can't win.
No one should be surprised.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
What did you say?
What time did you go to bed last night?
What should I do now?
Are you for or against my plan?
All journeys begin with a first step.
I want to get on with my life.
I will show you around the city.
"I'm busy, so I can't go."
Do you know something I don't know?
Everything is all right at home.
I just want a little more time.
We can't lose sight of that.
It's getting dark.
I can't believe that actually happened.
I require your advice.
Something had to be done.
When did you get there?
I can't see well.
Was anybody in there?
This dog is yours.
You were happy.
Are you responsible for this mess?
We're going to be late again.
He speaks French fluently.
I need to know who you are.
Tom is three years older than you.
I hate those kinds of answers.
They've written a bill for health care.
We're not open.
That was a good experience.
The meeting was all but over.
You weren't even there.
"Give me the car key, please."
She came to like the new teacher.
Not everyone was impressed.
I thought you were serious.
You all know what you have to do.
I finally caught up with my friends.
What are you staring at?
It's a gross distortion of the truth.
He's not perfect.
Do you come here often?
Everyone looked shocked.
Tom will always love Mary.
What did you get hit with?
Do you have a crush on my brother?
That isn't allowed.
That'll never happen to me.
You're fussy.
I freaked out.
Tom isn't accustomed to walking barefooted.
I hit the snooze button and went back to sleep.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
I'm taking a walk in a park.
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
Everyone fell asleep.
That's not something I want to do.
Her new hairstyle covers her ears.
Who asked for your opinion anyway?
I missed the bus.
I punched him in the chin.
I've heard a lot about you.
You're stupid.
Your pants are unzipped.
"Today, I'm not going to school."
You don't need to hurry.
They will get married next month.
Haiti is a nation that seems hopelessly impoverished.
Don't fall for his old tricks.
"Show me how to do it, please."
Where did you see those women?
Hand over your weapons.
I laughed so hard I almost cried.
Something's not right here.
You're smashed.
I'm coming at once.
Who cares?
I don't know anything about Japan.
"Of the eight, only one was found guilty."
Don't lie about your age.
I never thought it would be this bad.
I'm too busy to help Tom.
It's relatively early.
Do you believe me now?
Do you like white wine?
He knows everything.
Trust Tom.
I don't know what I know.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
What should I do in the meantime?
He has the habit of scratching his head.
"On my way home, I came across an old friend."
I know what they mean.
A triathlon is a forbidding test of endurance.
Keep driving.
A red dress made her stand out.
Don't make me wait long.
You're not dressed.
She cast an eye in his direction.
It's too late for me.
You work hard.
"You were jealous, weren't you?"
I appreciate your advice.
I also went there.
I'm sicker than I thought I was.
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
Were you followed?
I like to be prepared.
My wish has finally come true.
Here are some letters for you.
Is the movie theater near the station?
You're not that old.
The wind is blowing from the west.
Let's speak English.
Have something to eat.
Stop screaming in my ears.
Don't you want to come inside?
We must get together for a drink some time.
I wish I had been with her then.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
What you said is complete nonsense.
I don't want you to make the same mistake I made.
Is the battery fully charged?
Loneliness and being alone are not the same thing.
She handed him a book.
Choose the color you like the best.
I only slept for three hours.
Are you speaking to me?
That's the point I'm trying to make.
The cold weather kept us indoors.
What are you going to do tonight?
I am a bachelor.
You have to see it.
It's my left eye that's bothering me.
Go grab a drink.
Where do you watch television?
My father fixes broken chairs.
What do you think Tom told Mary?
She was advised by him to stop smoking.
I had a snack before I went back to work.
Come on! I can't wait any more.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Don't you see what's happened?
It is truly a nice day today.
She spends over a third of her time doing paperwork.
Tom isn't stupid.
I love this part.
I know that you know.
Do you want a hand?
Look on both sides of the shield.
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
It's great for families.
I have absolute confidence in your judgement.
Give me thirty seconds.
Everyone agreed.
Man has the gift of speech.
Shall I ask her to send the book to us?
They all need attention.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
You can't just not go to work.
That's not for you to decide.
I'm training for the triathlon.
I go skiing very often.
Tell me what I did wrong.
Do you know how the accident happened?
I'll give you a call in the morning.
Tom can't make it tonight.
Is reprinting this article a possibility?
This is the culmination of years of work.
Where did you go?
You're a prisoner.
I'd like to go to the movies.
What time does your watch say it is now?
What would've happened if Tom had come?
The door opens into the bedroom.
Tom began to shiver uncontrollably.
I know who lives in this house.
I didn't realize you were so rich.
I know how busy you've been.
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
Sometimes I hear things.
"It is not because I hate him, but because I love him."
They have many friends.
It's going really well.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
I am shorter than you.
Do you really think you can do that?
I'm not easily impressed.
I thought you didn't know that.
He ditched the car in an alley and took off running.
He tried with all his might to lift the box.
I'd like to know if she's arrived.
I want to want what you want.
Why can't I play with my friends?
I know what they're paying you.
You get out only what you put in.
My mother prepared me for the bad news.
The idea is not new.
"As the proverb says, ""Time is money."""
I have information.
I don't mind waiting.
They are leaving Japan tomorrow.
You must not make noises in the classroom.
You can't save me.
I'll be free this evening.
Why don't you admit your mistake?
Perhaps he could solve this problem.
There was only one survivor of the accident.
The reason for this is plain.
I prefer to go barefoot in the house.
I'm looking for a job.
I'll do it in the morning.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
We must go to school.
I was surprised by his perseverance.
I need to repay her.
I want you to be with me.
It's making me nostalgic.
I'm too old for Tom.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
I felt like an idiot.
Make a copy of this report.
I don't want to wait that long.
I don't think you'll like this.
The clerk waited on them immediately.
I'm sure she'll leave early.
How much have you made tonight?
She made him cry.
A map helps us study geography.
You must come with me.
His income is too small to support his family.
I'm mad at you.
That is a pencil.
She is awkward.
Please show me the way to the station.
Tom can speak French.
A dog followed me to my house.
I have bad news for you.
There's a spring in the center of the village.
"Tom likes skiing, too."
What is this for?
He never told anyone.
The wind was howling.
Stop screaming.
Let me know as soon as he comes back.
I hate silent movies.
That should only take me a few minutes.
You must be terrified.
I owe you a dinner.
Did you telephone him?
Let's start at 2:30.
No wonder he was arrested.
This is lame.
I'll attend.
Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn't do it.
Tom is always lying.
Put the scalpel down.
I'm thinking of visiting you one of these days.
I did what I had to.
Did you forget something?
You're quiet.
There are no more bullets in my gun.
We can't do this again.
You can spend the night at our place.
It's an old custom.
Don't talk about me.
"Something might fall on you, so be careful."
I caught my finger in the door.
Could you solve the problem?
What time does your plane leave?
This is hilarious.
You can do it.
You can't be two places at once.
"Get some sleep, okay?"
Do you consider them dangerous?
Who is the girl in your car?
I just can't wait.
What's the catch?
I just want you to be OK.
I can't invite all my friends at once.
I did something bad.
Why would anyone do that on purpose?
Please give me something to eat.
Soldiers shared their food with the Indians.
My short-term memory is getting shorter and shorter.
It's rather ironic.
Really?
Mother was afraid I would get dirty.
He did not listen.
My grandfather likes to walk.
She gave me a shy smile.
I made her cry.
It's an old pain.
"Life isn't fair, is it?"
No one can tell.
She is older and wiser now.
Tom seems a little disoriented.
Are you responsible for this?
You haven't given me what I asked for.
She was similar to me in many ways.
Your wallet is on the television set.
You don't need to answer this question.
There was little sugar left in the pot.
"""Where are my glasses?"" ""Where you left them."""
I want you to go upstairs.
I've already filed my report.
Thanks for taking care of all of this.
His complaints never cease.
His eyes betrayed his fear.
This story is worth reading.
I'm on holiday.
Why are you busy today?
Where did you sleep last night?
We took turns driving the car.
You're very brave.
Push this button and the door will open.
She is a pretty girl.
I wanted Tom to leave.
I have been to the airport to see him off.
I don't hate you.
The fog is growing thicker.
Don't make this personal.
We have nothing against it.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I made these.
It was a warm day.
I get on very well with your cousin.
Stop bothering me!
Enjoy your weekend.
She is afraid of cats.
Why don't you take a closer look?
You're foolish.
I can't trust him.
It was disastrous.
She spends her free time making dolls.
"If you buy me an ice cream, I'll give you a kiss."
Boil some water.
How old were you when your family moved to Boston?
I don't believe it.
Maybe you'd better come with us.
Did you have fun last night?
Tom does good work.
I'm not surprised you don't remember.
The plane flew above the clouds.
No one goes there anymore.
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
My shoes are too small. I need new ones.
Is it too far to walk?
I want to punch you in your face.
You're the sweetest.
Lightning struck the tower.
Tom and Mary looked at each other uneasily.
It would be better if we didn't attend that meeting.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
Beijing is bigger than Rome.
There is a boy near the door.
He might not be happy.
Don't you know what it is?
I had been reading for an hour when he came in.
You still haven't told me who he is.
Life is sweet.
We can't stay here. The roof is about to collapse!
I lost my watch yesterday.
All of my friends have bicycles.
I own this store.
You don't need to do that.
Those are all important.
I'm freezing cold.
It's not easy for me.
It didn't hurt at all.
A rose's petals are very delicate.
I would like to go with you.
"Tom is very young, isn't he?"
We sought to come to terms with them.
Sign this.
I'll ask my brother to give me a ride.
Tom is definitely feeling better today.
It seems that she is not pleased with the job.
Nothing is new under the sun.
Do you have my book?
I don't speak your language.
I'm uncomfortable.
How much did you spend on Christmas gifts this year?
I will wait a week.
I'm getting tired of your complaints.
She was indignant at the way she had been treated.
Just observe your cat and you will get to know him.
I think we can finish this later.
It was not my fault.
They'll never know.
When will it be ready?
You must not tell a lie.
Anyone can make mistakes.
I do agree with Tom.
I was stunned.
I use an electric toothbrush.
I have confidence in him.
I have a fear of the dark.
The man sitting over there is a famous singer.
I think Tom probably knows about it already.
Please sit.
I have so many ideas.
The water was blue.
The surviving refugees longed for freedom.
Have you put on weight?
I have no one to help me.
"She asked him to stay, but he had to go to work."
I don't deserve to be so happy.
I met them.
I eat with my hands.
We appreciate your understanding.
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
"This is your hat, isn't it?"
My aunt is older than my mother.
Did he tell you what to do?
You'd better not tell Tom.
He's very influential in the world of medicine.
It would have been better if you had left it unsaid.
I haven't decided.
I saw you yesterday.
Do you want to buy this?
"Clearly, that wasn't the case."
We wasted a lot of time.
This is his fault.
I don't know why you're all so angry.
Get out of my chair.
Give us a ride downtown.
I didn't go to school yesterday.
I paid in advance.
We worried a lot about you.
Which meat dishes do you propose?
It seemed like you weren't interested.
How many letters does the Russian alphabet have?
This is a sign.
We should've brought another bottle of wine.
He was visibly nervous.
I felt a little stiff.
It would be nice to get married.
She has a heated swimming pool.
Tom left home a few minutes ago.
I don't need anybody's permission.
The milk is sour.
I had a weird dream last night.
Have you ever been abroad?
What a beautiful sunset.
Have you ever been mugged?
Will you take me home?
Don't be scared to meet new people.
You know this isn't the way we should be doing this.
He went to art school to study painting and sculpture.
I don't speak fast.
Shake hands with Tom.
My uncle gave me a book yesterday. This is the book.
He was accompanied by his wife.
You can only come to China if you’ve got a visa.
Your examination results are excellent.
I helped my mother with the cooking.
Let's go back home.
She accompanied him on the piano.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Will you give me a ride to my hotel?
He was declared guilty.
Let's have breakfast.
Please come into the room.
I don't know how to help Tom.
This school supplies students with textbooks.
Do you love your mother?
She continued sobbing without looking up.
A nap would be good.
Don't make fun of them.
Which doctor is attending you?
Be prepared.
Are you lonely?
Get out of the van.
Who could take his place?
The early bird gets the worm.
How far are you prepared to go?
I glanced through the brochure.
That's not funny at all anymore.
She isn't poor.
The room is hot.
Do I look happy to you?
We were all wrong.
"That house is small, but it's big enough for us."
I had a feeling you'd say that.
He's not the same man he used to be.
You're preaching to the choir.
You're careful.
She mistook me for my sister.
I'm one of you.
Did you take him home?
You can't prove a thing.
I won't leave you behind.
He is looking at what used to be my father's desk.
We will get to Tokyo Station at noon.
That's a risk you have to take.
I just don't want to lose you.
I know what it's like to be poor.
He wanted to be a great military leader.
It's all nonsense.
I want some orange juice.
Who is it that you're working for?
Don't try anything funny.
She turned the doorknob slowly.
"Those grapes look sweet, but in fact they're sour."
Have you ever been kissed?
What precisely does that mean?
Do you know why?
I think we can do a lot better.
We were outnumbered.
Tom is good at math.
When did he get back?
I just got the news.
I really appreciate you helping me.
The bicycle is mine.
"Most, if not all, people enjoy eating."
Don't say such things.
I am no match for him.
His novel sold well.
Tell me more about yourself.
It'll be all right.
Did Tom know what to do?
They were playing tennis.
When is the breakfast served?
Are you interested in me?
My sister is pretty.
What year were you born?
Call me if you find something.
Our teacher likes his new car.
I wonder if you are truly happy.
I probably shouldn't have done that.
I may be too old.
Are those explosives?
Tom is quite authoritative.
I think they did it on purpose.
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
Tom knows a lot of people.
Are you going to take part in the contest?
"If not now, when?"
We have to take precautions.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
Tom told me he wasn't happy here.
What's with everybody?
Nobody can escape death.
We're sure that it was an accident.
My brother bought an electric guitar.
Lunch is included.
She advised him not to borrow money from his friends.
Why don't you give me what I want?
I doubt that.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
You look like a lawyer.
I feel fine now.
We must stay perfectly calm.
He dared not jump over the brook.
Over one hundred people came here.
We have two television sets.
They told me I had to help you.
He was wrong.
Are you ready to do that?
You start.
My mom works in a factory.
Horses run fast.
I let him sleep at my house for the night.
You are taller than me.
He avenged his dead father.
I saw what you did.
Life is very short.
"He's kind of cute, isn't he?"
She saw him driving his new car.
I didn't go to Tom's funeral.
He's a hopeless case.
You and I are good friends.
I like to play poker.
I made a bet that she would win the game.
Did he pass the test?
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
It has been her dream to be a university professor.
Do you like dogs?
How many times do I have to say that?
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
I'll be happy to help you.
Tom loves playing the piano.
Can you see that small house?
We have to study the matter.
Is that one of ours?
Do you like horror movies?
"In those days, I went to bed earlier."
You're not normal.
I gave way to their demands.
She takes care of my children.
We went to the café that I told you about.
I'm forgetful.
He traveled around the country.
I'm hungry.
They're cops.
Where is Paris?
Fire is dangerous.
I play tennis every day.
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
I don't sound like that.
Where do you come from?
I thought you wanted this.
You still haven't told me why you're here.
Apples were served as the dessert.
We're kind of busy here.
Did I hurt you?
It's a song.
You are suitable for the job.
She can't do that.
She acted like a real baby.
Tom got stung by a jellyfish.
We missed the deadline.
I like wild flowers.
He is no ordinary student.
That's the problem with doing things your way.
They danced all night long.
I hope you enjoyed the show.
Why don't you sing something for me?
I'm willing to help him.
It's a little nasty.
Spring is just around the corner.
Keep going straight.
Tom doesn't know where Mary parked her car.
I think that I should organize a little party.
Where did you grow up?
It'll take two hours to get there by bus.
I think it's time for me to ask for directions.
I'm feeling low.
It's Christmas.
I don't know how I did it.
How did you get into my house?
I can't put up with these insults.
He has been sick for a long time.
I thought you were asleep.
What are your pet peeves?
Do you know where it is?
What do you want to study?
She cut the apple with a knife.
What is wrong with that guy?
We were just about to call you.
Tom got up and walked to the door.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
I'll visit you at your office tomorrow.
They did the right thing.
Open your book to page nine.
I have to know why.
Don't kid me!
We ate some apples.
That sounds familiar.
They were so happy together.
Where is he running now?
I was one of the skeptics.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Have you ever broken a bone?
We came back to camp before dark.
Cover for me.
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
It's fifty kilometers to Paris.
Tom has a big mouth.
Stop spending money on stupid things.
You won't need me.
The club has more than fifty members.
My neighbor renovated her house completely.
Try to control yourself.
Have you asked if they want one?
Why did you turn off the lights?
Today is my sister's birthday.
I agreed to help him in his work.
I wish someone would help me do that.
What is the total amount of money you spent?
I'll give him a pen.
It's all I know.
Tom still loves his job.
I'm looking for my cellphone.
I'm not good at classifying things.
He missed his flight.
He became brave in the face of danger.
I had forgotten how beautiful you are.
He was working at the office yesterday evening.
Let's not go into details.
Let's get down to brass tacks and talk business.
My mother cut the cake.
That was unnecessary.
You didn't turn in your homework.
I don't wear glasses.
Tom inhaled.
Don't let this chance slip by.
Smoking is harmful to your health.
Don't expose it to the rain.
I'm alive.
I rang the bell.
I cannot whistle.
Stay with us for a few days.
I'm glad he liked it.
We haven't had much rain this year.
Stay and have a drink with us.
I feel a sense of duty.
You should have attended the meeting.
You're not alone.
I just don't believe you.
I just can't live without you.
"Hey, can we get a move on?"
I suppose you want to use my office.
Don't go without a hat.
I like flowers.
They're afraid of me.
I went to the hospital.
I had to do everything on my own.
Have you been waited on?
I almost never eat breakfast.
I can get us there more quickly.
I love what you've done with the place.
He lied to my face.
We had a rough time.
Three people have been arrested.
Tom's married.
I'm not your son.
This feels like silk.
How do you like them apples?
Please call the fire department.
This word is derived from Latin.
I wish you had told me the truth.
I feel a little awkward.
I'll go home.
Don't be sorry.
I'm attentive.
Did you like it?
This product is fun to use.
Give me a hand with this.
Kissing a smoker is like licking an ashtray.
She was more beautiful than all of the others.
"I'm not talking to you, Tom."
Tom knew that Mary was trying to do that.
You learn quickly.
I am a cook.
"All of a sudden, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach."
I hate being late.
They adore Tom.
I have just a few bullets left.
Love doesn't exist.
I ordered the book from England.
I like to eat apples.
I asked my teacher what to do next.
Wouldn't you like to drink some tea?
Tom registered to become an organ donor.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
They escaped.
How do you stand this heat?
Keep to the left when driving.
Can that be achieved?
Are you all doing well?
She is no longer what she used to be.
Show him how to do this.
They're looking for you.
All of the milk was spilled.
What exactly are you looking for?
Who will you give the book to?
May I go to the bathroom?
"I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you."
You're the one who planted that tree.
I've never had a friend like you before.
He devoted a lot of time to study.
A good poker player can tell when someone's bluffing.
I have an ever growing list of to-do items.
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
Love will prevail.
I didn't see it happen.
She was at a loss as to what to do.
How am I supposed to dress?
Give it a shot.
No one will help us.
I could answer all the questions.
It's said that she's a well-known actress.
I drive everywhere.
May I take pictures here?
I figured you might change your mind.
I don't gossip.
I slept the rest of the day.
I think you should do it.
I have looked for it up and down.
There are no food stores in the immediate area.
Don't try God's patience.
What did you get hit with?
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
They swam.
What would cause that?
Tom knows that.
I think he's right.
Clean it up.
Take as long as you need.
Can he speak Japanese?
I was astonished.
Your house is fantastic.
That's not even the worst part.
We may as well keep it a secret.
Do you really want to go there?
You ought to keep working while you have your health.
Where is it hidden?
I never use this anymore.
His cottage is on the coast.
I thought you might come.
I'm looking for a French penpal.
Are you all set to leave?
That's not my style.
I'd love to know if my luggage is arriving soon.
Leave him alone.
You're nice.
He seemed to like that.
I'm tired of being careful.
He is in good physical condition.
Let's see what happens.
The car wasn't making that noise before.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
I need Tom's help.
The team approved his proposal.
Bring me a dry towel.
Crying won't solve anything.
Tom does little other than play the guitar.
She liked that.
He has a few friends.
I am very sensitive to the cold.
Just take a deep breath.
The police say they know you had an accomplice.
My cat rubbed her head against my shoulder.
I have to hurry!
Who will be elected chairman?
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
He doesn't watch television at all.
Why did you kiss me?
I don't want you touching my stuff.
Everyone looked relieved.
Tom says he's never owned a car.
Tom kissed Mary good night.
Tom's French is almost perfect.
I don't know much else.
My father is intelligent.
I could really use a change in scenery!
We heard a gunshot.
How do you know how deep the lake is?
See what I mean?
I can't read your mind.
There is no grass on the moon.
That isn't what I'm looking for.
We discussed the problem at length.
I like the way you talk.
What were you doing in that cave?
The mailman left a letter for her.
Pull over here.
He is said to have died here.
Nothing could sway his conviction.
The sky is clear and full of stars.
Tom said that Mary was beautiful.
"If you don't miss the train, you'll get there in time."
I can't find time to read the book.
I'm skinny.
I was really frustrated.
Stay down.
Watch how I do it.
Most people are idiots.
We could sing together.
Don't tease me.
I did all the work.
What's making this sound?
Someone is watching you.
Be ruthless.
Were you excited?
I hate to lose.
Can you tell me what it means?
How did you get so good at French?
I don't think I like it.
Tom always shouts when he is angry.
Tom has far more experience than Mary.
She is extremely attractive.
I love my country.
We all cheered.
Where did I put the hammer?
Abandon ship!
I've had a wonderful time here.
Do you really think Tom will do that?
Tom knows.
It is a very sad tale.
They crushed all resistance.
He is still angry.
She's a single mother of two.
He likes coffee without sugar.
I think Tom knows what he's doing.
Tom is a great actor.
My heart began to race.
I don't want to marry you.
Do you want to go?
It's stuffy in here.
How old do you think I am?
Are you proud of me?
This bread is hard as a rock.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
What would we do instead?
A storm kept the ship from leaving Kobe.
She found him standing near the entrance.
The doors lock automatically.
My uncle gave me a present.
Don't throw stones.
"I must do that, I think."
I was offended.
I left Tom a message this morning.
She passed away peacefully in her sleep.
We had a good time last night.
I feel very chilly.
Would you like some water?
I can't decide what to order.
"As I entered the room, they applauded."
The accident happened because he wasn't careful.
He's a fine young lad.
I stayed home to rest.
I can't stop watching.
The party's over.
She didn't know what to say to him.
Are you American?
I'm glad you brought that up.
He never turns up without making a fuss.
I want time instead of money.
He was unaware of the danger.
I think it's time to leave.
You're a true friend.
Are you sure?
Do it this way.
We're both fine.
We drove into the night.
I'm a vegetarian.
I need a receipt for that.
What time do you get up every day?
He was having lunch when I entered the room.
That's the tough part.
I had a pretty happy childhood.
You're cruel.
That's so sweet of you.
Did you push the button?
Did you know this was coming down?
Be merciful.
The road turns left there.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
It is snowing.
I'll pick you up at your home at five.
The woman is taking notes.
Did I interrupt something important?
She went out.
I appreciate the support.
Tom will always remember you.
I'll handle it.
You are liable for the debt.
How accurate is it?
Life without love is meaningless.
We should do this more often.
That's not my signature.
That's not unusual.
He died ten years ago.
The situation is hopeless.
She told him that she was leaving.
Are you deaf?
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
She admits knowing the secret.
Tom will never be able to do it by himself.
I just cracked a rib.
"Hopefully, Tom will get into Harvard."
It was not easy to get a lot of money in a short time.
I like old cars.
The police found the politician dead in his room.
We're going north.
That's a pagoda.
That house is famous.
The lecture covered a lot of ground.
"Cats can climb trees, but dogs can't."
Are you good at keeping secrets?
No one else knows this.
You would have to practice the violin every day.
I waited for him all day long.
Reading books is very relaxing.
The book was better than the movie.
This is my younger sister.
What's your favorite fruit?
How do you know where to go?
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
People are stupid.
Do you really think Tom will help us?
Look up the number in the telephone book.
How did you kill the guards?
I have to live on my very small income.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
She slept for a few hours.
I spilled my drink.
Tom can't use this.
Today is election day in Poland.
Does your girlfriend like flowers?
There used to be an old temple here.
"I ran as fast as I could, but I missed the train."
You've got to be bold!
You fainted.
She's waiting for you at home.
I wonder why he is so angry.
Are you familiar with the rules of soccer?
Is the dog swimming?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Can my friend sleep over tonight?
I just assumed you wouldn't mind.
You're such an idiot!
That hardly seems fair.
He doesn't need to work.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
Tom taught me French.
Tom doesn't even live in Boston.
It's a matter of national security.

Don't jump to any conclusions.
She made a mess of the work.
I have a wooden comb.
You're hiding something.
Tom slapped Mary.
You can't keep this a secret.
I could hear everything.
The girl caught a small fish.
She complained about my low salary.
He has more books than he can ever read.
It happened so fast.
Tom seems dangerous.
I hope the police catch whoever did this.
I'm not the guy you want making this decision.
That student raised his hand to ask a question.
You said you wanted the truth.
Ecology is the study of living things all around us.
Did I not mention that?
"We didn't want to go, but we had to."
You will get the worst beating of your life.
We're very busy.
My wife is a good manager.
I had to see someone on business.
Let's go outside and sit in the garden.
Math and English were my favorite subjects.
My friends dropped by to see me the other day.
Do you have a ticket?
I couldn't help laughing when I heard that story.
Let's take a break for coffee.
Please wake me up at seven tomorrow morning.
Can we fix this?
She may realize later on what I meant.
It was Tom that told me this story.
His family didn't have much money.
She likes nobody and nobody likes her.
Are you happy?
He sat there surrounded by his children.
Does that surprise you?
We're not buying.
Tom talked to Mary yesterday.
"Look, I don't want to lose my job."
Come here after you have washed your hands.
They've been damaged.
She refused to accept the post.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
The mere sight of a mosquito makes her sick.
The roads were empty.
Her story turned out to be true.
He has been warned on several occasions.
I hope we can fix that.
Someone will do that job.

Who ate all the cookies?
You must accept your role.
The spinning top skidded across the floor.
"Quit talking, will you?"
"If you want to talk, talk."
You've been warned.
He isn't happy at all.
That's a bit extreme.
You're very clever.
Get that thing off of me.
Stop being so nice to me.
So what happened to you anyway?
I would rather stay home than go out.
I suggested that we should start at once.
Does that suit you?
Is there a woman in your life?
I want you out of here right now.
I think he's attracted to you.
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
You have to memorize this sentence.
I grew up around here.
Quit complaining.
I met her on the street.
There were no consequences.
I've never lied to you.
You need to do this.
Get out of the truck.
We listened to her for some time.
Thank you for your advice.
I want a book to read on the train.
It's snowing here.
It may well be true.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
I've got a bad memory for names.
He loves her.
Don't touch it.
Perhaps you should buy a gun.
I made these.
I often have bad dreams.
Are you implying something?
"You were sleeping, weren't you?"
He is wearing glasses.
You're not going to want to miss this.
We speak English in class.
Where did you get the idea?
I don't feel like taking a walk this morning.

I am not interested in material gain.
It is almost three.

What's the minimum wage in Australia?
This is not a sentence.
The lake is a long way from here.
There was a list of available candidates.
I'll call them.
It's no concern of mine.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
I like your article.
He is too short to get at the book on the shelf.
The soldiers could do nothing until spring.
She keeps her diary in English.
I am 24 years old.
I could hear everything.
He longed for his mother.
I left my key in my room.
The meat's not ready yet.
Talking to Tom isn't going to help.
I cut down a cherry tree.
"No matter who comes, don't open the door."
They should have one.
He was absent from school because he was sick.
I want to know everything you know.
Do you like rock and roll?
The sidewalks were wet after the rain.
Suni is playing.
Was that you I heard singing in the shower?
I can't imagine what you're going through.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
Tom enjoys watching sports on TV.
It's quiet.
I have misjudged you.
He told me that I should be more careful.
I wish you were close to me.
I believe in friendship.
The boy I love doesn't love me.
Our hens laid a lot of eggs yesterday.
The old lady climbed the stairs with difficulty.
Why didn't she come?
Close the blinds.
Would you do that if you had the chance?
I should probably not be doing this.
You should exercise more.
She did pretty well.
Tom eats nothing but his mother's cooking.
You should be proud of yourself.
Parents should monitor their children's whereabouts.
You must see it to believe it.
He left his keys in the car.
I wasn't in a hurry.
We live close to the station.
Are you busy?
What do you think of these?
Your answer differs from mine.
I found your letter in the mailbox.
I have got to go now.
A car hit Tom.
What's your name?
What do you do on Sunday?
France used to have many colonies in Africa.
Guess what I ate for dinner last night.
Do you think they're coming after us?
Tom broke the rules and was kicked off the team.
Why don't you share it with me?
"This is my umbrella, not Tom's."
All his friends backed his plan.
"I'm sorry, I don't buy it."
They entertained us at dinner last night.
"If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow."
I'm looking forward to that.
I do have one question.
We're not convinced yet.
You've got to be kidding!
I forgot to call him today.
How far are we going?
"You're Germans, aren't you?"
I forgot to give him the message.
Can you drive?
I'll meet you outside.
He removed his shirt.
I wouldn't be too surprised if this song became a hit.
Tom will be happy to see you again.
I just kept my mouth shut.
I thought you were taller.
That sounds really bad.
I haven't decided what to do yet.
Now I remember.
I'm glad you're here with me.
I'm not saying anything.
He must be over sixty.
Don't play with fire.
Seeing is believing.
How much is that going to cost me?
I was born there.
I can't stand fishing.
I don't want to hurt her.
I told you it was going to be cold here.
How much time do you spend with your spouse?
How long do they wish to spend here?

You look smart.
The weather is turning nasty.
My wife is very upset.
He cleared his throat before starting the lecture.
What's your speciality?
She advised him to read more books.
Someone tried to kill me.
Turn it up.
A dog bit her on the leg.
Tom says he already knows how to do that.
Will you go?
Why should I even care?
I don't know if it is good.
"This time, you've gone too far."
You should not break your promise.
Do I have to go right now?
The students have returned.
I don't believe any of this.
I'm not an expert either.
What did you do yesterday?
Tell me the meaning of life.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
I want a new dress.
They live nearby.
"You don't know where it is, do you?"
I'm not entirely sure.
Do you know any good places to eat around here?
I deserved that.
No one knows the answer.
Enjoy your evening.
I suggest we drink as little as possible to be polite.
I'd like to know the truth.
Do your homework now.
I will go if you go.
And with that we finish the activities for today.
He gave me an example.
She asked him to call her later.
Are you sure you can handle this?
"In spite of the rain, I went out."
The child talks as if he were a man.
The result of the experiment was inconclusive.
I had a bad cold and was in bed for a week.
I would like to call on you one of these days.
I want to go to Sweden.
Proper ID is required.
I don't have all day.
I'm begging you.
Somebody saw you.
You don't have to explain.
Do you sometimes study in the library?
What could they possibly want from us?
It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
Tom doesn't like being criticized.
Tom said that he'd pay the bill.
A heavy rain began to fall.
Three of them were hospitalized.
How many books can I take out at one time?
Tom read the letter aloud.
Stand back!
You're adorable.
I wrote a letter in French.
"He said, ""It's nine o'clock."""
That was awesome.
I know that she is cute.
We are staying at our uncle's.
I'm confident that you'll succeed.
Can I speak to you?
My grandmother on my mother's side lives in Osaka.
He kept on crying.
The sentence is free from grammatical mistakes.
I don't really know anything.
Tom says he's read this book three times.
Have they spotted you?
I just love that kind of stuff.
"If you want me to, I'll do that for you."
How do you think that makes me feel?
This won't be easy.
We need to advertise on television.
I don't yet know what I'm going to do.
Tom can't help Mary.
You can't fix it. You should buy a new one.
She deposited a large sum of money in the bank.
"Once you learn it, you never forget."
Let's not be enemies.
All you do is complain!
You'll get another chance.
I think you'll find this interesting.
I appreciate any assistance you can offer.
I can't give you anything.
Let's say that you're right.
Tom tried to talk to us in French.
Let go of my arm!
Have you taken your medicine yet?
This is what I was looking for.
Tom doesn't seem too convinced.
Thank you for listening.
Tom is in college now.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
I've lost my dignity.
"That's cheap, isn't it?"
She's a fine young lady.
I'm very upset.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
Use the manual override.
That's what you always do.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
He can't stay long.
I'd like you to help me install this software.
Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
Where did you learn all that?
Tom can walk.
How did that happen?
My suitcase is broken.
It's a big decision.
"A man shouted something, waving his hand."
I argued with him about it.
We don't have a pool.
We're closing early.
I remember this word.
The wind carries seeds for great distances.
"It's him, isn't it?"
I would rather not go.
The dog seems to be sick.
Did I give you enough time?
I feel a little responsible.
The old couple sat side by side.
I'm glad you decided to come.
They're cool.
They have very little to live on.
I drive.
She did not answer all the questions.
A teenager sometimes acts like a baby.
She has many valuable books.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Tom goes to the barber less than four times a year.
My friend was arrested for speeding.
We worked together.
No one likes me.
Where did you go for spring break?
Don't try to stop me.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
You've got to be kidding!
I tried in vain to persuade him not to smoke any more.
I have to change clothes.
That wouldn't be a good idea.
I can get you out of prison.
What time does it open?
What's your favorite holiday?
He has been waiting for an hour.
Do you like school?
Don't take any chances.
We have ample time to catch our train.
Do you know where Tom is going?
What do you think of these shoes?
Nobody in the world wants war.
Is Sunday the first day of the week?
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
It feels like an orange.
Did they tell you why you had to do this?
We took a long walk.
I want to know the reason for his absence.
The weather is cold all year here.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
That's not big enough.
It wasn't me who started the fight.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
Let's be honest with each other.
Come off it!
I thought you were asleep.
I've seen this picture before.
He's in for a shock.
You're overreacting.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
Tom trusts me.
I didn't want to miss the party.
I forgot to shutter the windows before the storm hit.
Don't talk to anyone.
Tom went skiing alone.
I'm glad you're OK again.
There's nothing we can do about it.
That way I kill two birds with one stone.
Are you sure you can do this?
Tom will always be here for you.
All of them died.
He was invited.
How do you plan to make amends?
I think it's a great idea.
What am I supposed to do with what you gave me?
"If you could do it, would you?"
This blue sweater is very pretty.
Do I have to go to the party?
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
You're stuck.
I hope that Tom didn't do that.
They want to participate in the Olympic Games.
Tom will be arriving any moment.
Stay away from my motorcycle.
I prefer to remain seated.
Did you turn off the gas?
"I had some free time, so I wandered around town."
How did I get into this?
I talked about music.
I think Tom is old.
Do you want to leave it like that?
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
It's a big city.
"You're sure about this, right?"
I figured I might find you here.
We're not fools.
I am 18 years old.
How beautiful this flower is!
Did you give a copy of the disk to anyone?
They stayed friends.
Mr. Jackson is a great teacher.
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
Does anyone care?
Let's visit my grandpa this weekend.
What's your favorite breakfast food?
"When I lived in Rome, I took the subway every day."
He is said to have made a fortune in oil.
Would you come with us?
"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
Do you know him at all?
I feel happy when I'm with you.
You can take it.
I have high blood pressure.
What is it with you people?
Any chance of us getting approved?
Air is a mixture of several gases.
I bet you've never climbed a tree.
They said you were fired.
"Close the window, will you?"
She told him that she believed in astrology.
That law took effect today.
The lady came from a good family.
Tom hates Halloween.
Please don't go away.
Don't make me go.
You've been very kind to me.
I think my job is pointless.
Tom said Mary told him that.
I'm not proud of that.
Are all of them your friends?
It's not as easy as you think.
She introduced the lady to me.
What do you need a doctor for?
Tom was alive.
Your driver's license has expired.
This bus will take you to the station.
My father disapproved of my going to the concert.
Do you want me to wait?
Why didn't you read the magazine?
They were born one month apart in 1970.
He is the man you can rely on.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
Do you have more than one copy of this key?
Do you remember anything?
I spent the whole day reading that novel.
This watch is broken.
I've missed another chance.
It's time for bed.
Tom looked really tired.
He is less intelligent than me.
I know you're angry with me.
Please tell me what this means.
My father works in a factory.
He can't explain what happened.
Please sit down for a moment.
She acknowledged that she couldn't speak French.
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
He has very bad luck.
He found me a nice tie.
How much will it be?
I want to see you in my office.
He acted like he owned the place.
Are there any apples on the tree?
I felt cheated.
I wanted to tell you that.
I had a little help from a friend.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
None of us knew the answer.
I don't like to take on the heavy responsibilities.
Are you hurt?
Please make yourself at home.
She tried to conceal her grief at the party.
The official dinner took place at the White House.
We can't satisfy everyone.
Can't you see a stapler somewhere around there?
They refused to join the army.
He is a scientist who is respected by everybody.
I remember one poem in particular.
"If you are hungry, you can eat the bread."
You look younger.
Tom wants me to coach him.
It started as a hobby.
"No matter how rich you are, you can't buy true love."
We enjoy talking.
Get on your knees.
He was involved in a murder case.
I want to speak to your manager.
Teenagers often argue with their parents.
We don't have as much in common as I thought we did.
How are you doing these days?
It's like being in a candy shop.
Hold the rope.
Tom is still confident.
"Unfortunately, there was no one around."
Don't knock it unless you try it first.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
Are you feeling under the weather?
Why don't you share it with me?
Tom is there to help Mary.
Can you please tell me where the restaurant is?
He is not kind to her.
The boy enjoyed painting a picture.
What would you do in this type of situation?
He asked me who that man was.
"You can do it, too."
"After a while, corn flakes in milk will become soggy."
The child threw a stone at the dog.
She lost her new watch.
I've never heard of you.
We didn't actually see the accident.
We need a password to use this computer.
Watch out for that man.
Do you really think it's impossible?
What do you do for a living?
He got more than he bargained for.
I don't disagree.
You can't keep this a secret.
All I want is your cat.
It seems to be a good house.
He made a gesture of impatience.
You should apologize.
He hasn't actually eaten caviar.
You're big.
We must observe the rules.
Tom and Mary both said no.
Tom is angry a lot of the time.
I knew Tom would accept my invitation.
It's a matter of the utmost importance.
Tom showed me his photo album.
"When he saw the policeman, he ran away."
I didn't see you.
You could have told me.
Can you read French?
He was playing tennis all day.
We can't do this without some help.
They look bored.
I am near the station.
Pump up the tire.
That is how it happened.
I could not have done otherwise.
He never breaks promises.
"I know the reason, but I can't tell you."
Don't trust him no matter what he says.
This is your pilot speaking.
I like good coffee.
I agree with him.
She baked me a cake.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
I had quite a busy day today.
She is aware of my secret plan.
But I was careful.
I don't see how that would help.
Are you lying to me?
Whatever she says is true.
I have come in response to your ad in the paper.
I'd like to rent your most inexpensive car for a week.
I need some get-up-and-go.
Where did the money go?
Tom is not dumb.
Do you need anything?
Tom got off the train.
Wash your hands.
This morning I missed the train I usually take.
Be kind to those around you.
That's a photo of my sister.
He ran so he would get there on time.
I read the entire book.
There may be some truth to this.
Do you have any plans for today?
You know what I'm talking about.
I just did what they told me to do.
How much did you bring?
I'm here to ask for your help.
I don't know what else we should do.
I don't know where to go.
Let us out of here.
I have three cameras.
I have the dictionary.
Please let go of my arm.
You're sleepy.
Do you understand what's going on?
"I'm sorry, I don't really remember."
Did you sleep all right?
She spends all her time thinking about boys.
You need to be prepared.
Do you consider them dangerous?
I feel like a rest.
Tom is a common name.
Why didn't you apply for the job?
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Where did you find my umbrella?
There's nothing funny about that.
He doesn't live in my neighborhood.
Have you got it yet?
The street is empty.
What does USB stand for?
You are so childish sometimes.
Tom showed us a photo of his mother.
I got sucked in on a lot of phony deals.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
I was a little put out by this.
Tom is still in shock.
His soldiers feared and respected him.
I can swim.
The enemy attacked the town.
We're survivors.
I'm lucky to have a job.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
She was named after her grandmother.
How do I delete this file?
I almost didn't sing that song tonight.
Tom wants me to apologize.
Do you mind much?
How many rooms are there in your house?
Why wouldn't you let me go to Tom's party?
I thought I was alone.
The police searched the premises thoroughly.
The book is here.
My father runs a restaurant.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
I'll do it with you.
I really do appreciate all your hard work.
I think she is sick. She has a temperature.
Are you happy right now?
You were Tom's only friend.
I want to retire.
You can visit NHK any time.
I've always wanted to go to Australia with my family.
Please copy this page.
The car hit a tree.
I think I can do it.
It seems a cruel thing to clip a bird's wings.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
"If it were not for exams, we would be happy."
I have to comb my hair.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
It was raining last night.
My tooth hurts.
Don't let anyone enter or approach this room.
I met some friends while I was waiting for a bus.
I can't believe you're giving up.
Everything's taken care of.
We need to win.
They've been damaged.
I hate sand.
We should go to the party.
Did you win the trophy?
He got hooked on drugs at a young age.
The bus should be here by now.
I never felt this way before I met you.
I just can't do that here.
I think your dreams are achievable.
I'm happy with that.
We took turns cleaning the room.
I'm going back home tomorrow.
I'm intrigued.
Tell me what you think's inside this box.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
I can't blame him.
I'll never forget having a good time with you all.
We must run.
No one says that anymore.
Do you travel a lot?
He acted the part of King Lear.
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
I believed that.
It was a ship with a crew of 25 sailors.
Don't forget to take your pills.
You won't need it.
This is a pretty amazing place.
No one knows me like you do.
About one third of the earth's surface is land.
Will you please let me go now?
What will we eat?
He turned his attention to the picture.
How did you know what I was thinking?
I just want to go home and sleep.
I need to be prepared.
The baby wants its mother.
He went to the library.
Do you want to see something gross?
I won't make the same mistake next time.
Let's do something different.
I read an interesting article this morning.
Where is the closest pharmacy?
You could've been hurt.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
I am in the habit of taking a walk every day.
What don't you have?
I'm about ready.
You can't leave me.
I don't know how this works.
I want to lose a few pounds.
You're very sharp.
That's alright.
I love to swim.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
I have a pretty tight schedule today.
This is my fate.
I brought reinforcements.
"If you're not listening to the radio, turn it off."
I had no one to turn to.
She lit the candles.
Break time's over.
Your phone is ringing again.
Did you do this all yourself?
You will know the truth some day.
He was challenged to a drinking contest.
I learned to live without her.
We were never allowed to celebrate Christmas.
What kind of wine do you have?
They were all good swimmers.
I just want to be perfect.
What else can you tell us?
Please don't speak so fast.
"He was sick, so he did not go out."
I wish they would stop fighting.
I don't understand what all of the fuss is about.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
We live in the country during the summer.
You're overreacting.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
I was quite at a loss for words.
You have to do this whether you like it or not.
Get that thing off of me.
You're very emotional.
Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
What's wrong with you?
What do you like about him?
Have you learned nothing from your mistakes?
I entered Tom's office after knocking on the door.
It's a good camera.
It won't be that hard.
Shouldn't that count for something?
You will be paid according to your ability.
I enjoy eating with you.
We look out for each other.
May I use your toilet?
I always feel sleepy.
I'll call you as soon as I've finished.
Are you blowing me off?
He's good at this sort of thing.
You're fortunate.
He was nearly run over at an intersection.
I like your beard.
Do you like robots?
I want you to tell me about your trip.
I think it's obvious.
Don't get yourself killed.
She told me that she had bigger fish to fry.
I know that I was wrong.
I never had a girlfriend before.
I think you'd better leave now.
What's your favorite number?
You just wouldn't understand.
Listen closely.
Where were you three years ago?
These machines aren't working now.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
What are you drinking?
We can't allow this.
It is unfair.
He kept staring at me.
I've heard that song before.
I feel sorry for you.
Neither one of them disagrees.
Websites collect information about you.
I love my mother very much.
We're not getting anywhere.
He will never give in even when he is wrong.
Don't you care?
That can't last.
Today is Sunday.
Have you ever given money to a beggar?
What if the unthinkable should happen?
You're half right.
We have had more snow than usual this winter.
It won't take long.
My uncle said that he jogs every morning.
He seldom writes to his father.
He's crying.
Where's Tom now?
Is that deliberate?
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
She went to rehab and straightened herself out.
That sounds stupid.
I think my German isn't very good.
We never learned what happened or why.
Be serious.
Don't tell Father about this.
I'm always forgetting people's names.
I can't do this job alone.
Do you want me to handle this?
Tell Tom what you mean.
Tom adopted Mary's three children.
Tom didn't do anything else.
You're too hard on yourself.
I can't make promises.
We made it out of there.
We talked on the telephone.
You've got to go even if you don't want to.
I'm no match for Tom.
Did you say something?
You're no different.
I can't stand this hot weather.
You're either with me or you're against me.
You have the same camera as mine.
Have you finished your homework yet?
I also noticed that.
Please ask someone else.
Wait one second.
I went camping with my family.
Tom says he doesn't want to study French.
I've already apologized for that.
They look happy.
Do you fly frequently?
What's in the file?
What do you see in him?
This dress fits me very well.
I don't like being controlled.
We work every day but Sunday.
Tom fell asleep while driving and caused an accident.
We'll discuss it later.
Tom fixed everything.
They have enough money.
It's not easy to thread a needle.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Tom's parents were asleep when he got home.
Tom says that's a lie.
He gave me authority to fire them.
How is it going?
"It will cost around 10,000 yen."
He tried to restrain his anger.
He wrote to me from time to time.
I gave them a present for their anniversary.
They're very fond of him.
This is my room.
Our feelings towards him are mixed.
I don't know why you want me to do that.
What's going to happen?
I want this luggage taken to my room at once.
I'm sorry I shot you.
I'm strong enough.
I was beginning to worry about you.
Don't do that.
They were acting strangely.
I don't really understand this.
Find somebody else.
I was beaten.
It's already dark outside.
"You were jealous, weren't you?"
Those who want to remain may do so.
Tom talked too much and let the secret slip.
I hate spinach.
He came running.
He had fifty dollars.
He fell down on the ice and hurt his leg.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
I don't speak fast.
The children were left to fend for themselves.
What do you think of this plan?
There's a cat there.
I gather you were hurt.
I did smoke when I was young.
"It's a matter of when, not if."
"Since you're tired, you should rest."
I borrow books from the city library.
I figured you'd want to know.
Why do you really want to lose weight?
Does this bus go to the center of town?
He is a good doctor.
The heat's preventing me from sleeping.
It takes years to master a foreign language.
I'm very happy to be back home.
"Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed."
Summer has ended.
Do I have it right?
Do you feel all right?
I want to know what this is all about.
Just try it out.
I want you to listen carefully.
I have a rough idea where it is.
How did you get to know about her?
I bet you're busy.
Do I have to spell this out for you?
What were you thinking?
I see you've made a friend.
Do you want some sugar in your coffee?
"Your name, please."
Tom can't help you.
You're better than me.
Don't throw away this magazine.
I forgot to telephone him today.
Have you been up all night?
She is anxious to meet you.
I hear that she's a famous actress.
I forgot his phone number.
He didn't want to sell the book.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
I'm Korean.
Take a break.
He's waiting for the train to leave.
Let's speak in English.
We're just nervous.
He didn't like to be punished.
Tom is blind.
They drank coffee.
Can anybody else answer?
I'd never let that happen.
Don't cheat him.
I didn't see anything strange.
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow.
Your brother wasn't at school today.
She often goes to the movies with him.
Are you sure they can do this?
Every dog has his day.
You look younger.
She has a 10 percent interest in the company.
There's something under the bed.
We spent the weekend with friends.
He came after you left.
I'm looking for my wallet. Have you seen it?
Tom eventually joined the navy.
He wrote to me yesterday.
English is also studied in China.
I think you'd better come back home.
Mary is not wearing a bra.
My father's car is new.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
I know that there was a big church here.
He gets up as early as five every morning.
"She asked him to call her later, but he forgot to."
The light is green.
"Turn around, please."
"Tom never used to smoke, but he does now."
I have been to the airport to see him off.
I came to see Tom.
I don't have as much free time as you do.
Is the window open?
"She bought him a sweater, but he hated the color."
Tom isn't really as rich as everyone thinks he is.
I want to be here with you.
I'd like to go to college.
Tom told me he was wounded.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Which is your favorite team?
Doesn't that smell great?
"He can speak Russian, too."
I have a little money with me.
You should have telephoned in advance.
It may have been Tom that wrote this note.
Why didn't you tell me?
I can't accept this theory.
I like that answer.
Can you promise me you won't tell Tom?
There are around three thousand mosques in Istanbul.
I'm in the bathtub.
Do men cry?
You're not sick.
She earns more than she spends.
Mom and Dad are very nervous.
I love poetry.
You're observant.
What direction does your house face?
He is less patient than his brother.
Who was the girl you were talking to?
He's sure that he'll pass the next exam.
I got dizzy.
It's still in good condition.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
Where's the nearest bathroom?
Are you just going to stand there all day?
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
He doctored his report.
He stared at me from head to foot.
"Come on, sing with me."
The troops had plenty of arms.
The soldiers had more powerful weapons.
What kind of person would do that kind of thing?
They love this song.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
I don't quite believe what he says.
It is a love song.
The first attack missed the target.
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
Tom was genuinely worried about Mary.
Are you on your way home?
They looked as if they would cry.
This is by far the best method.
I'll quit.
We got separated.
We want it back.
I just love bargain sales.
Check these out.
All our children go to school in Boston.
No one was present.
Who are you trying to impress?
There was nobody there.
"Could you repeat that, please?"
Please visit us at your convenience.
Why were they scared?
I hope we didn't wake you.
Your necktie matches your suit.
Let's stop talking and start working.
Try it once again.
I went on with my reading.
We've seen drastic changes since then.
I cannot describe my feelings.
Tom struggles with this concept.
I'm not wearing this.
How did you come by this painting?
I like picnics.
They're just for you.
We're not invited.
I stayed up all night.
"Sorry, but I am unable to do so."
I don't want to be different.
Are you sure you can do this?
She really wants to go.
That's all I have for you.
I have some stuff to do at home.
Why don't I drive you?
Let me give you a bit of advice.
I knew you liked me even though you never showed it.
I don't like snow.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
What are your duties?
I had to get out of there.
I know just what you need.
Do you have a cellphone?
Wires carry electricity.
Can you help me paint my house?
"You tried to stop Tom from doing that, didn't you?"
They can't believe it.
How do you know so much about it?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
He stopped drinking.
He didn't eat anything yesterday.
You should have taken a chance then.
He was put in prison.
This is the office in which he works.
I warned you once.
I know who you are.
What I can do for you?
Please take off your hat.
That restaurant is too expensive for me.
I found the book I had long been looking for.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
They are exhausted.
Let's get this party started!
Tom is very difficult to get along with.
My cat is going to have kittens next month.
I don't like being inside.
I'm invited to a party tonight.
They are matters which we need to discuss.
You're drunk.
She's gone on a trip.
We've sold all the tickets.
The war began three years later.
How can I become rich?
Why are you protesting against the government?
I want to buy something to eat.
We're not the only ones who've made mistakes.
I understand your language.
Thanks for supporting me.
His company went under during the crisis.
Money opens all doors.
That's never happened to me before.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
Tom went home with Mary.
Some of the crew were drowned.
I've seen this before.
This desk is broken.
Tom passed most of the time fishing.
Tom didn't say a word.
I want to start over.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
What kind of movie do you want to watch?
I had to make a choice.
I'll do it according to your instructions.
Get on with it.
I need hand lotion.
Why doesn't anybody help you?
"The more chocolate you eat, the fatter you'll get."
That's what I'm worried about.
Would you slow down a little?
Who was the woman you were talking to?
I asked him about the accident.
He's not very good at it.
Nobody is forcing you to do this.
I want to leave this place quickly.
Things are not what they seem.
I don't eat as much meat as I used to.
How did you find us?
Did you encounter any problems?
You're so mean.
Who is standing there?
A dog will bark at strangers.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
What time did you close the store last night?
I haven't eaten all day.
What makes you think that Tom will listen to me?
I want to stay here a couple more days.
Do you plan to buy that car?
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I don't want to offend you.
She didn't have a brother.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
You can go back to bed.
I will do anything to please her.
She gave him all the money that she had.
Tell them what you told me.
This is the village where he was born.
I'll get you a towel.
Your friends are waiting for you.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.
I was incredibly bored.
Get out of the classroom.
I'm realistic.
I just couldn't resist doing that.
I know a lot of people don't agree with me.
I'll walk out with you.
I could've married Tom.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
The child is learning quickly.
I'm fed up with him.
I can be there in an hour.
I'm glad I invited you.
I thought you'd be alone.
His hair is so long it reaches the floor.
Tom paused to catch his breath.
It wasn't funny at all.
She pulled my shirt.
I thought my parents would be proud of me.
He fought until the end.
The airline sent my suitcase to Boston by mistake.
Is my laundry ready?
I'd like to improve my French.
Be fair.
Do I need to be at the meeting on Monday?
He has left already.
Everybody calls me Tom.
Did you read everything?
He wears a bow tie every day.
Don't buy me presents anymore.
I wish I could afford to buy a car like that.
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
They agreed to start early.
"Hold on for a few minutes, will you?"
I should've married your sister instead of you.
He has a loud voice.
Have you read the leading article in today's paper?
She said she would be back soon.
Who can blame you?
This is what'll happen.
I think that will be all for today.
I wish today were Friday.
I take a bath every day.
I don't remember anything happening.
It took half an hour.
I feel lonely.
This oil painting dates from the 17th century.
It's all over for us.
Ultraviolet rays are harmful to us.
If only I'd been a little taller!
The car is ready.
I need to get something to eat.
Did you forget something?
What are you two staring at?
It's hard to resist temptation.
She advised him to use a bicycle.
Tom didn't have anything else.
I am very sad.
There's a lot to do.
They eat meat once a week.
"Tom, I'm happy for you."
Try to learn a little English.
Would you want to live like that?
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
He was holding a large box in his arms.
I lost my sunglasses.
Do you know who I am?
I want you to do this.
There is little money left.
Tom met Mary on the way to school.
Our TV is out of order.
We have to do better.
Don't believe what she says.
You don't have to sing.
We heard shots in the distance.
"I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?"
Everyone worked very hard.
Ask me anything!
The results were far from satisfactory.
Are you happy with how you look?
I am going to study.
That's how it was.
If it happens to rain tomorrow I'll stay at home.
It reminds me of my childhood.
You seem happy.
How much is it?
I'll see you again this afternoon.
They supplied the war victims with food.
What're you drinking?
We'll begin work soon.
You're going to have to leave.
The troops were annihilated.
I'm involved.
His family did not have much money.
I always have a couple of beach towels in my car.
Are you proud of yourself?
This isn't your office.
That's what I'm trying to do.
I like to talk.
He hung a lamp from the ceiling.
I did that.
I can't imagine life on another planet.
I own a horse.
You did nothing wrong.
This T-shirt is too small for me.
I have some news for you.
Tom despises Mary.
What are your intentions?
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
"A nice day, isn't it? Why not go out for a walk?"
"He is not a singer, but an actor."
I don't know why Tom is whispering.
That's not something I would joke about.
That's how most people do it.
Not all baby animals are cute.
That's what I'm saying.
My uncle now lives in comfort.
It's still in limbo.
"If that guitar were not so expensive, I could buy it."
I'm going to a monster truck rally.
I wish to make a complaint.
How long do you have to eat lunch?
I have a question.
I really should be getting to bed.
Do you know something I don't know?
At least you'll have something to write home about.
I thought you'd be happy.
I promise you I'll never leave you.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Leave the room as it is.
It's transparent.
I should've added more salt.
A stranger spoke to me on the bus.
"When he finds out, he won't be happy."
I don't have the slightest clue.
I'll get rid of them.
I like dogs very much.
What time will dinner be served?
It hurts.
Stay with us for a few days.
Don't make me come after you.
"This time, I think you're right."
My sister and I went to the castle.
Tom sat behind his desk.
The price of vegetables varies from day to day.
You're very understanding.
I thought I told you to stay in the car.
I caught a cold.
Thanks a lot for your help.
Tom is no ordinary man.
My mom told me that I was fat.
You have no proof.
"Could I have the bill, please?"
I thought you wanted a divorce.
Your friends sound nice.
I'm a little angry with you.
"To tell the truth, she is my cousin."
I think Tom is a coward.
I'm only going to say this once.
You're temperamental.
I don't have to answer your questions.
She is a particularily interesting person.
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
Tom is a real charmer.
I think we can do it.
Tom is guilty.
Cook for me.
We love you so much.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt."
We're just tired.
Let's go downtown.
I never should've told Tom my password.
I am glad to accept your invitation.
We'd better get out of here.
We have to get up early tomorrow morning.
This is a big project.
Tom ate what little food he had left.
He has three older sisters.
Don't look at us.
How many did you want?
I want to hear you play the piano.
Tom needed a good job.
I like that job.
The accident happened at that intersection.
Don't try to be a hero.
I've never read a novel in French.
Let me see it.
You ran a red light.
You have to judge the case without bias.
I'm used to it.
He got his dander up.
My driver's license will expire next week.
She celebrated her fifteenth birthday yesterday.
Do you drink wine?
That couldn't happen.
We have our differences.
Where's the shopping center?
I'm not privy to their decisions.
"You want to leave here, don't you?"
The man left the restaurant without paying.
That's what I did today.
Let's wait for another 5 minutes.
I met a man from Boston this afternoon.
It happened that the day was my birthday.
My daughter is getting married in June.
It was careless of him to make such a mistake.
I bought this for my boyfriend.
She picked up a stone.
I feel safe.
What time is dinner?
The car broke down on the way to the airport.
The birds were flying in a group.
I respect those who always do their best.
We spent hours looking for it.
I don't like Tom so much.
Do you really want to stay young forever?
The man aimed a gun at the policeman.
"We've got a situation here, you know."
I left a message for Tom.
I cannot thank you too much.
I make it a rule to study math every day.
It's natural to be nervous when the plane takes off.
Who is your favorite author?
My brother is eight years older than me.
Do you have any left in stock?
You can't just not show up.
I want to apologize.
I'm doing my homework.
I didn't even know his name.
"To my surprise, he refused my offer."
One of the girls was left behind.
You knew I was here.
What did it feel like?
I thought you were serious.
I hope you'll come to my birthday party.
He fills the bill.
I thought Tom was in school.
He saved my life.
I wasn't trying to hurt anybody.
Give me your address.
This photo was taken by Tom.
We'll have to pull an all-nighter.
I refreshed myself with a hot bath.
"When he arrives in Tokyo, I'll call you right away."
My mother grows flowers in her garden.
I have some powerful friends who can help you.
I need to know now.
I was taking a shower then.
I just don't remember.
"If you're going to kill me, I want to know why."
What did you hide?
Tom's name was on the box.
I feel empowered.
Can I talk to you about your son?
I never wanted that.
I don't want to be tied to one company.
"Strangely enough, I didn't feel any pain at all."
That's not an issue.
I am running short of money.
What a shock!
I never thought I'd get that lucky.
I'm very glad to see you again.
You must take his age into account.
It affects all of us.
Let's wait and see how things go.
Try again.
Asia is much larger than Australia.
"Take off your socks, please."
I don't hear any voices.
I'm glad you could come to the party.
Please forgive me for forgetting to call you.
Does he live here?
What's your age?
You should have been more careful with your health.
I'm afraid of dogs.
He really makes me angry.
You did your part.
He is leaving Chicago tomorrow.
He suggested that we take a short rest.
I was astonished.
Don't look away.
I hope he will get better.
He returned to Japan.
What's your favorite color for carpets?
Rainforests provide the earth with many benefits.
"The cellar is ugly, dark, and stinky."
Good luck. You'll need it.
How exactly am I supposed to do that?
Let's party.
Do I have to undress?
Watch closely.
We should follow his example.
The mayor didn't like what the journalists wrote.
I'm surprised to see you.
It is up to you to decide what to do.
Not everyone was pleased.
I hope we can still be friends.
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
I'd rather be in Boston.
I just want this to be over.
What will happen to her?
You can't go yet.
There was a sudden change in the situation.
I felt uncomfortable.
He had his shirt on inside out.
What do you call that contraption?
"I know you're busy, but I could use some help."
You can't do both at the same time.
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake.
We're going to miss Tom.
You should stay in bed.
We're all wasting time.
Tom disagrees with Mary on that matter.
I'm trying to save room for dessert.
I had to see you.
You're double-parked.
How long will the storm last?
We all like him.
Don't be so lazy.
You must realize that by now.
"Speech is silver, silence is golden."
She has brains.
Tom eventually joined the navy.
I remember meeting her somewhere.
He often eats breakfast there.
Somebody's made a mistake.
I just cut my finger.
There are some things that I don't understand.
Parents provide protection for their children.
I don't understand what's bothering you.
I went there for the purpose of meeting him.
What do you feel like doing tonight?
Tom pulled the fire alarm.
We complained that the room was cold.
I didn't break it.
Are they going to fight?
Wait in the waiting room.
He has a passive character.
You're not a suspect.
There is a lot of work to do.
He's attracted to black women.
Tom told me he used to be rich.
He dumped me.
Take out your notebooks.
I have been a teacher for 15 years.
I want to know who your friends are.
"His cousin, whose name I forget, was a nurse."
How many of you agree?
Why does everyone think I'm stupid?
This forum is great.
He doesn't know what it is to be poor.
I used to be your age.
He looked up the word in his dictionary.
No one is invulnerable.
Latin is a dead language.
There's nothing wrong with him.
You can eat as much as you want.
He tried to soothe the angry man.
I'd rather be poor than rich.
Tom and Mary dated for 3 years.
I almost forgot to tell Tom about the party.
He got 90% in English.
I have an interest in cello and piano.
I'm listening to Björk's latest song.
My grandmother became sick last week.
Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
It's ours.
The candle went out by itself.
I'm leaving you tomorrow.
Do you enjoy living dangerously?
I can't see well.
I think your English has improved a lot.
What if you gave a speech and nobody came?
His house is across from mine.
Do you sometimes give your sister money?
There is no wine in that bottle.
Someone is at the door.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
It's a fine day.
I already did that.
Do I look presentable?
There were only six people at the meeting.
Is there any reason not to go?
It's nice of you to give me a lift.
You're running a big risk in trusting him.
She attempted suicide.
She stood close to her husband.
Tell me where you went.
I like going to the movies.
His heart beated slowly.
I'm getting used to eating alone.
She didn't want him to go out with other women.
"You were dying, but the doctor saved your life."
Cook the rice.
We were fully satisfied.
Tom has braces on his teeth.
I destroyed all the evidence.
How long did you stay at the party?
Why would anyone want to kill me?
Do we have milk in the fridge?
Today's meeting has been canceled.
We're not needed.
This one is all yours.
That's what I don't understand.
We were forced to work hard.
Do you think there's something wrong with me?
Tom could've been seriously injured.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
How's your cold?
She wasn't polite to him.
I found an apartment.
"That was a big surprise, wasn't it?"
"The more, the better."
She wouldn't speak to him.
He broke the window on purpose.
I asked for a seat in the non-smoking section.
Tom wasn't a suspect.
You're a filthy liar!
Do you think I should go alone?
Would you like me to tell the truth?
This is very ingenious.
The walls were covered with graffiti.
He is standing on the hill.
Will it rain this afternoon?
She advised him on that matter.
Your efforts will bear fruit someday.
We must observe the rules.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
You deserve more than that.
I'll order that later.
I couldn't stop laughing.
They each received a present.
Don't kill me.
I didn't say I wasn't free.
This young man knows little about his country.
I want to learn karate.
I'm curious.
He became a pianist.
I'm not your servant.
The first step is the hardest.
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
What have you done with my luggage?
He lived a long life.
Is that really you?
You're precise.
I wanted to hear you say that.
There is little wine left in the bottle.
We've got a job to do.
I finally got across the river.
Maybe he likes you.
I didn't see the accident.
Tell the maid to make the beds.
I really must have my watch repaired.
You got it all wrong.
I want to sing a song.
Are you sure you're up for it?
How do we stop it?
That plane will take off at five.
How would you like your eggs?
I didn't plan on staying here so long.
She met him only recently.
Your feet are dirty.
Tom is biting his nails.
Typhoons hit Japan every year.
What's with all the questions?
You can take either book.
Have you started reading the book yet?
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
I do have one request.
This racket belongs to me.
What were you doing about this time yesterday?
This is just the type of car I want.
They forced me to take the medicine.
It couldn't have been better.
Can I try it?
You are trusted by every one of us.
Did you leave a tip?
She is quiet.
"By the time she gets there, it will be nearly dark."
I wasn't listening.
I don't think I have one of those.
I think you can handle it.
Didn't you promise never to tell a lie?
How much for half a kilo?
It looks like you've been crying.
You should get your eyes examined.
She advised him not to eat too much.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
Is that why you're upset?
This is ludicrous.
Straighten up.
Tell Tom to stay where he is.
Tom has been very generous.
I had never seen him before.
We climbed up the steep mountain.
"""Where's your book?"" ""On the table."""
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Do you think we should just wait and hope it changes?
I beat him at chess.
Please be polite.
It was a weird feeling.
I'll give you a call.
I'm not denying it.
Tell me what really happened.
"I'd like to go, too."
Don't fall off!
I didn't see your car outside.
I wish you were here with me.
We know all this.
I don't know how to do this.
It's pretty incredible.
"You've lost a little weight, haven't you?"
Let's divide this money between you and me.
Please smile.
"You're not ready yet, are you?"
I had to get something out of the car.
Just wait a second.
I'd like to live in that house.
I will finish my homework by nine.
He didn't dare say anything.
We found the front door locked.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
Try to have fun tonight.
I can't believe my eyes.
He's the laziest person I know.
He cooked me dinner.
Tom was having a bad day.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Everyone is going.
You have to go.
Why don't you run for student council?
She can't cook well.
She went outside to get a breath of fresh air.
You must be in love.
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
I don't find that funny.
Tom is an old man.
I think we need a doctor.
Tom told me he was innocent.
"If you turn on me like that, I won't say another word."
She's the most beautiful woman.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Can you at least be happy for me?
Business before pleasure.
Are you crazy?
Does it hurt?
You really are nuts.
I think it's too late.
It just came out.
I'm giving you what you want.
I decided to take his side against the others.
I'm a little bit tired.
She ignored him all day.
We'll all be home in time for dinner.
My cat died yesterday.
Take a look at this map.
Tom really likes traveling.
When will you start?
I'm so glad Tom won the race.
Let me heat it up some leftovers for you.
I'm not creative.
You need to wash your hands.
What took you so long?
Thank you for the link.
Why are you acting this way?
He was elected mayor of the city.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
She has a pretty face.
Do you have a pet?
She didn't show up.
I made a judgment call.
Did I leave my umbrella here?
I'm glad you liked my friends.
He wants the money.
He retires next spring.
I know it's none of my business.
You can't bury your head in the sand.
What is happiness?
Even children can understand it.
I meet him at the club from time to time.
You did it in front of the staff.
My father gave it to me when I was a kid.
I know that I haven't been a very good father.
He concentrated on that.
Do you mind if we sit down?
Get my rifle.
Do you need a deposit?
Children often hate spinach.
I hope this is worth it.
He's good at cards.
You can go if you want to.
He said that I must go there.
Do not take any notice of him.
How are we going to get inside?
You should have kept it secret.
She saw him at the station.
Stay in the car.
Are you sure this is the right train?
"Quit talking, will you?"
I put my clothes in the dryer.
I reached the village before dark.
I love to take pictures.
I usually have a light breakfast.
Tom barricaded himself in his room.
We need a bit more time to prepare.
"If I were you, I'd follow his advice."
It is time I left here.
Tom had a good reason for being late.
It's more fun than studying.
Do your parents speak French?
It took a long time to analyze the data.
Next time I'll come earlier.
Tom has been told several times not to do that.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
That's very serious.
You can say whatever you want to.
It was a pretty amazing experience.
I want to work in a hospital.
I'm the boss.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
I want you to know what really happened.
I did what I had to do.
She picked up the phone.
We need your assistance.
It smells delicious.
I don't know how you do that.
I owe what I am today to you.
Did I give you enough time?
I have so much to show you.
Let's go out and have a good time with our friends.
How much is it?
I love you the best of all.
The chief justice will swear in the president.
I need a pencil sharpener.
I have to confess to you that I snore.
Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
She had forgotten her umbrella so I lent her mine.
"I have problems with my wife, too."
I remember having seen this movie before.
How come I've never seen you here before?
He attached great importance to the event.
They gave us their word.
I eat here.
I'm going to the bank.
You could hurt yourself.
Tell us about your family.
You'll be in trouble.
His curiosity knew no bounds.
Wow! It's been a long time.
Haven't you ever kissed a girl?
"Tom is lucky, isn't he?"
He needs to speak English.
I feel like I'm making progress.
They accused him of telling a lie.
I don't plan to vote in the upcoming elections.
May I take a picture of you?
I already gave it to Tom.
You're not late.
I don't know what you really want.
You won't believe who came by today.
What is today's date?
Am I waiting in the wrong place?
It's acceptable.
I'm not entirely sure.
I didn't hear anything.
When did you start writing songs?
I like your place.
You don't need to stand up.
Farmers always complain about the weather.
My house is close to a bus stop.
I strongly advise you to use this.
I don't want to live here.
I have many model cars.
I can teach you how to do this.
Tom isn't rich.
She committed a crime.
Beat it.
Do you think this is some kind of game?
I have written down his phone number.
There was music.
Don't be so careless!
I wish it was Valentine's Day!
Do you know anyone from Boston?
He has quite a few records.
Don't be so pessimistic.
There was blood everywhere.
Are you ready to go?
You're very tall.
I see you are ready.
I can't just kick Tom out.
A helicopter flew overhead.
How about going to the movies on Saturday?
He has something to do with the traffic accident.
I'd never played that game before.
No one is there.
I couldn't tell her from sister.
You still haven't told me who he is.
"Having seen him before, I knew him at once."
How lucky you are!
Is the school on this side of the river?
You're resourceful.
It's been a long time since I've had a real vacation.
They voted.
Did you hear the roar of the lions?
This is the house he was born in.
Tom just got back to Boston today.
Gas was escaping from a crack in the pipe.
I want to leave this city and never come back.
Let me go and buy some bread.
All of these letters are addressed to you.
Tell us all the gossip.
He's running for Congress.
He put his hand to his forehead.
This could have unintended consequences.
I ran like lightning.
Don't waste my time asking stupid questions.
It's two o'clock in the morning.
It took me two hours to memorize this sentence.
I have no way of knowing that.
We have no complaints.
Call us when you get there.
Why is life so full of suffering?
I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.
He never loses hope.
I don't think Tom is listening.
We're not free yet.
We grow a variety of crops.
One cannot make dogs out of cats.
I don't ever want to see you again.
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
I do not know who is good enough for him.
His neighbors are suspicious of him.
He was not able to marry her.
Get out of my seat.
That's good enough.
This is an extremely important point.
I'm really busy.
I don't have a tattoo.
Have you tried the chicken?
Were you the one who rung the bell?
"""Do you think he will come?"" ""I hope not."""
I made dinner.
I wanted to make a good first impression.
Misfortunes rarely come singly.
I came here to save you.
Would you like to join our team?
Do you consider them dangerous?
I do not want to reply to his letter.
This old coat has had it.
My friends are all married.
Tom's French is perfect.
I never wanted to harm you.
A man is responsible for his deeds.
The syntax of Python scripts is very simple.
Drugs can ruin your life.
It's worse than you think.
Do you know what love is?
What would you like me to do with this?
He's got the biggest eyebrows I've ever seen.
I work every day except Sunday.
Do you want in or not?
They abandoned the sinking ship.
I didn't know you had a dog.
I tried to cheer him up.
Everything has been arranged.
There's a new sheriff in town.
Not much has changed.
He got up earlier than usual.
They said you were fired.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
We have no further details at this time.
Tom is trying to do that.
I didn't need to paint the fence.
Let her replace it.
"Obviously, it's not working."
Tom doesn't know how computers work.
I don't know why Tom is always complaining.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
She always walks to school.
Tom is sleeping like a baby.
Why is this light blinking?
Please have someone else do it.
She left her children behind.
He walked back and forth in the room.
None of Tom's classmates liked him.
It could've been a lot worse.
She made jam from the apples.
Do you understand or not?
We can't do this without you.
Tom didn't like the concert very much.
They're looking for you.
Are you interested in me?
He reminded his wife to wake him up at 7:00 a.m.
Elephants live in Asia and Africa.
She could not keep her daughter from going out.
What's your favorite kind of fish?
This snake is not venomous.
He stuck his pencil behind his ear.
I know what we can do.
Have a good weekend!
I want you to put in a good word for me.
I guess it's possible.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
He's your son.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
You're not special.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
He buttoned up his coat before walking out the door.
Life is boring in a small village.
She spoke up for him.
These shoes belong to Tom.
We'll be back after this short break.
We have to deal with that first.
The files are missing.
Don't be afraid to get your feet wet.
"If you're not happy, quit."
I have a lot of ideas.
Photography is an expensive hobby.
I guess that's right.
She tore his letter to pieces.
He sat and listened to the radio.
I'd like to go home.
Please write it down.
I'm a bit of a reader myself.
Don't forget to take out the garbage.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I sat behind a very tall person at the theater.
Be still.
Astronomy is an expensive hobby.
The heater is warming up the room.
They're very busy.
Information will be provided on a need-to-know basis.
Tom is important.
Do you take me for a fool?
I would've never guessed that Tom was from Boston.
This was supposed to be simple.
I keep a diary every day.
It's hard to believe that's a coincidence.
There is no hurry.
Do you want another one of these?
Keep your head low.
What do you think I should pack for my trip?
He has recently made remarkable progress in English.
I don't know how old I am.
Painting is another thing I can do fairly well.
I've left my charger at home.
I didn't tell anyone about it.
I hope everything is okay.
I'm the best.
I appreciate you coming here.
What cold drinks do you have?
I've been waiting for you for over a week.
"Frankly, I don't care."
I'm certainly not your friend.
Tom will be cremated tomorrow.
You can't be thirty years old.
Tom tried to control his emotions.
He got angry with me.
Old people wake up early.
I want to try it.
How many did you take?
Why don't you go talk to him?
"""Will you pass me the sugar?"" ""Here you are."""
I don't believe that either.
I have had an inspiration.
The concert was a great success.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
I continued reading.
Are you questioning my judgment?
That's a filthy job and I don't want to do it.
I want to be here with you.
You obviously don't have time.
Tom had every right to be angry.
I'm not old enough.
I don't have any questions.
Are you children all right?
I knew you'd be mad.
I appreciate your situation.
I wish nothing but the best for you.
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk.
"During the war, factories ran around the clock."
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
I really liked that.
Does she have a big nose?
Tom believes Mary is wrong.
She sent her son for a doctor.
We're almost ready.
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
She has a cold and is absent from school.
Tom forgot to feed his dog.
I burned the cake.
Has something happened?
Did you see what Tom just did?
This is highly illegal.
"I want to know more about you, Tom."
Tom can't do anything about that.
I was barely able to work.
I was uncomfortable.
He wishes to erase bad memories.
That dog is big.
Is there anything that I should not eat?
I think they're lying.
It's never too late to start.
We will not fail.
That's exactly what he wanted.
Shall I cut it in half?
That's not such a bad idea.
Why do you want that anyway?
Do you need our help?
I've never seen you like this.
Are you all right?
He remained abroad ever since then.
They must be replaced.
Tom comes from Boston.
I had a drink or two before you came.
He wants you to come home.
We can't give up.
Something is going on here.
I'm sure everything will be OK.
He narrowly escaped being killed.
The robber aimed his gun at the police officer.
I knew there was something fishy about that guy.
I felt scared.
Do you really want to put your life in her hands?
There isn't much furniture in my room.
It's business.
Tom asked for a raise.
Did you learn to speak French when you were a child?
I never go on vacation without my cellphone.
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
Please keep this information to yourself.
They slept in the same room.
A Japanese would not have said such a thing.
I wanted Tom to help me.
I've never seen him before.
Have a safe journey.
He will come tomorrow.
Don't tell me you can't swim.
"Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed."
I'm not going to die.
I regret eating those oysters.
We have mutual friends.
Tom wants Mary to keep him company.
You can't kill us all.
I like listening to good music.
I need something to eat.
Tom has a meeting tomorrow.
You're stuck.
That doesn't seem right.
Do you think I'm crazy?
This car was so cheap that he could afford it.
I found something interesting in the town.
Do you want to hear my theory?
"We can't be sure, can we?"
You don't want to keep him waiting.
He was my first boyfriend.
Would you be willing to write a letter for me?
The first round is on the house.
Where do you think we came from?
He crushed the sheet of paper up into a ball.
We need a knife for the butter.
That's not my name.
You will succeed some day.
I knew this would be hard for you.
I don't know how much time we have.
Tom hasn't seen Mary yet.
I remember seeing you before.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I'm lazy.
Fishing is prohibited here.
Please tell me you're kidding.
It was an awful week.
We are very similar.
I have an appointment to dine with him.
I must go alone.
He left for America the day before yesterday.
Is there a flight in the afternoon?
He wears pajamas.
I didn't know she was married.
I'll pass.
I shouldn't have drunk that last bottle of beer.
I'm such a fool.
I was not sure what to do.
I made a sandwich for you.
The law doesn't apply to this case.
There is nothing more important than friends.
"If I had known about it, I would have told you."
I was drunk.
You're productive.
We could go out together like we did last year.
Did you also invite your friends?
What did you do with those books?
That bed is very comfortable.
Will that make any difference?
Careless driving causes accidents.
I just finished cleaning the attic.
Do you really want to know the truth?
They guarantee this clock for a year.
I have nothing further to say.
Is there anything you want to add to what I just said?
Don't they drive you mad?
Is your name on the list?
That isn't to my liking.
Is it true that Tom won the race?
I have lived here for thirty years.
I was stupid enough to believe Tom.
A guard's been killed.
Does Tom have green eyes?
She did not visit me on Sunday but on Monday.
They're playing our song.
I'm skinny.
The teachers teach all day long.
She is five years younger than me.
I was speaking.
I had a crush on you when I was twelve.
You have to do this whether you like it or not.
I have not seen him since.
Let's get to know each other.
What's she doing?
I just don't want to do that right now.
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.
Tom is always joking.
Glad to see you again.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I'm not letting you go.
Let's go to the picnic.
Could you let him out?
That's all you need to know.
I don't even want you there.
You knew the answer all along.
You don't sound very confident.
I wish I could be more spontaneous.
I called my neighbors over for dinner.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
Is it always wrong to take a human life?
I feel sick.
Are you courageous?
He got tired of reading.
Take a look at these.
He hates spiders.
I owe you a lunch.
His mother speaks Italian.
"If you want a sandwich, raise your hand."
The tire on my bicycle is flat.
I didn't want to bug you.
My wife is always finding fault with me.
Tom's very unpredictable when he's been drinking.
Football is my favorite game.
It's beyond me.
I have a sister.
The ball rolled across the road.
It seems that everybody likes golf.
Night is when most people go to bed.
Tom may not be as happy as he seems.
Are there oak trees on the hill?
I have a place to sleep.
We are out of danger.
I don't know if I should tell him.
Let's go as soon as it stops raining.
"Today, everything went awry from the start."
Do you know the reason why he cut class today?
Are you in Paris?
I can't believe you actually did something like that.
This bird cannot fly.
I don't think your seeing him is good for you.
Which one is broken?
I cannot help loving her in spite of her many faults.
I had to lend to him money.
I am right.
I think you must be getting tired.
"If I were in your place, I would not do so."
They arranged a meeting.
I am very pleased.
May I visit you tomorrow?
I don't have the strength to keep trying.
You're very timid.
Tom has passed away.
Would you be willing to show me how to do that?
Just give it a shot.
I went to bed after eating.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
How much does this tie cost?
I regret doing that.
Tom looks very anxious.
That child wants someone to play with.
He chuckled.
I hope the weather will be good.
Would you like one?
Lend him as much money as he needs.
I had no notion that you were coming.
This work doesn't pay.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
No one's talking.
Aren't you going to open the box?
"You really don't get it, do you?"
The book is on the table.
Tom bought a box of candy to give to Mary.
Tom is preparing dinner.
Are you sure that you want to quit your job?
We'd like you to sing a song.
I knew we should've done that.
He still loves her.
How many medals did the Japanese athletes collect?
I am going to start a new job next week.
Have you heard from the rest of the team?
She grew up to be a lovely woman like her mother.
This is unsatisfactory.
I got my hair cut today.
They were playing footsie under the table.
Where's that coming from?
You won't be the only one there.
Everyone is entitled to be moody once in a while.
You can do whatever you like.
What are you doing in Boston?
He lives in Osaka.
There is only one bath towel.
"A long time ago, there was a bridge here."
The airplane took off on time.
"Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed."
You must be a good cook.
I'm sorry about last night.
I feel kind of tired.
A fierce battle was fought here.
She cremated him within 24 hours of his death.
I'm not rich.
I've started learning French.
Maybe Tom should quit before he hurts himself.
That was the hard part.
How many times have I told you not to use that word?
Have you even heard a word I've said?
I feel strange.
I'm delighted to meet you.
He told me where to shop.
We didn't look very long.
Somebody's coming.
He began to cry loudly.
"As far as I know, she hasn't left yet."
This is not my specialty.
He had an accident.
They only sell women's shoes here.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't want to go.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
He is an expert in astronomy.
I'm not sure this is necessary.
Please show me another one.
"Personally, I think you're right."
I just want to hear you talk about it.
I have enough money to buy it.
My children don't listen to me.
I can't stand this pain any more.
We all sang in unison.
You must not give up hope.
I forgot something.
I don't want your business.
This is what we want to know.
Tom likes Mary just the way she is.
Why are you so happy?
"Well, aren't you glad to see me?"
Tom left Mary a note.
I owe him my life.
He is one of my neighbours.
I guess I've been too busy.
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
We cannot afford it.
I'm staying out of it.
I think I understand it.
I met him in Tokyo by chance.
Tom is growing a mustache.
This is irregular.
What can you tell me about that?
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
Where exactly did you go?
You are the one.
Learn these names by heart.
I'll give you a call.
Don't show off.
I'm glad you decided to come.
I know you've been trying to help.
I owe you a sincere apology.
Tom says he saw nothing.
No one looks busy.
Why did it have to be us?
This is hogwash.
I guess Tom wasn't really Mary's boyfriend.
Thank you for your present.
He said the same thing over and over again.
I have never had more than $500 in my possession.
We have to make sure we do that.
Is the horse black?
I'm telling you the truth.
I know what you want to do.
She has a scarf around her neck.
He is introverted.
I can't hear a thing.
I don't have a lot of options.
The mountain was covered with snow.
"You're new here, aren't you?"
I love you more deeply than I can say.
"At last, he came."
We spent a lot of time on our lessons.
Find the differences.
Is it all wrong?
He kept his hat on.
She came to see me the other day.
I told you it would work.
All I can do is to do my best.
His hobby is stamp collecting.
I had some work that needed finishing.
I love you just as you are.
You're not the only one with this problem.
I've never been so embarrassed.
He took us to the zoo.
There is no life without water.
I was the one who knocked on the door.
Bring it here.
I don't know what your problem is.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
This tie and that jacket go well together.
I lied to my parents.
I had a promise to keep.
His father is a physicist.
Give me the car keys.
We wish you a pleasant flight.
"When it rains, she feels blue."
I was not drinking.
I know I should've stayed in Boston.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to live.
Where is Father?
The streets are clean.
Didn't I show you my new Mustang?
That's a bad day for me.
I thought we could do better.
She advised him to lose weight.
I'll stay there till six o'clock.
He removed his shirt.
You don't have to go.
You dropped your pencil.
He is an American.
All of us are disappointed.
What did you do on your vacation?
Where is your dog?
Why did you try to run away?
What are you going to do tonight?
I am so exhausted!
Tom is a very good-looking guy.
He stayed at a cheap hotel.
She is engaged to him.
All of them will get a prize.
It's very easy to use.
Are you American?
You're not aiming high enough.
Tom saw a mouse.
A lot of students do part-time jobs.
Do you know where it is?
The boss has a good opinion of your work.
This is by far the tallest building in this city.
We're a couple.
I hate to eat alone.
She saw me enter the store.
Tom took three deep breaths.
Did Tom say that?
That's not what it means.
I usually get what I want.
That's not what you used to say.
"Two ice creams, please."
Algebra is a branch of mathematics.
We're grateful.
I don't think I can answer that.
Back off!
I talked to my friend in the FBI.
He hasn't returned yet.
I already told you.
I can squeeze you in.
Have you ever been in prison?
He has adapted extremely well.
This sounds fishy.
He can't do it.
I don't expect anything from you.
Her mother has made her what she is.
The dog bit my hand.
I think you'll find this interesting.
Does that suit you?
I need to handle this alone.
I'm extremely fat.
What you need is a friend.
This is a difficult time for all of us.
Pandas are beautiful animals.
How many years did Tom spend in Boston?
I'm surprised.
Are you proud of me?
Most of the plants died.
Everyone in her class likes her.
I won't go.
I left my jacket in the classroom.
I think Tom may be dead.
I believed that he was a doctor.
Is Tom alive?
His achievements were acknowledged.
We're sloshed.
He asked about you.
I am yours and you are mine.
Don't make trouble.
They found the stolen money.
I can't tell you the answer to that yet.
Her skin is smooth.
Be respectful.
I ran away.
You could've told me the truth.
I do not know how to drive a car.
You're in no position to bargain.
I got really mad.
She bought a tea set.
What did you just say?
You're courageous.
Prices have dropped recently.
I know that you feel helpless.
I didn't tell that guy my name.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
I don't know whether he will come or not.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do such a thing."
I always take some exercise before breakfast.
The recent frequency of earthquakes makes us nervous.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
You're not the only one who feels that way.
Where is the school?
This is easy.
"If I'd known it, I'd have told you."
"You don't understand me, Tom."
I feel different today.
Nothing can change that.
This kind of book is of no use to us.
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
Why don't you drop her a line?
The boats collided head on.
I know that she doesn't know who I am.
This is sweet.
I want to be worthy of your friendship.
The Murais have been married for ten years.
I know you've got more important things to do.
Don't get so carried away.
Please translate this into French.
He looked back at us many times and walked away.
"You're alone, aren't you?"
I'll try to keep it short.
Stop playing with that.
Tom threw something at me and I ducked.
Violence against anyone is unacceptable.
I still believe in love.
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
Everybody blames you.
The day we arrived was a holiday.
Lock the office.
Tom got his teeth whitened.
You're really absent-minded.
I found it easy to find the building.
Tom described the incident in detail.
He threw in the towel.
Please handle it with the utmost care.
He runs in the park every day.
I really like garlic.
You don't fit in here.
She wanted to help them.
I'm through.
It's a misunderstanding.
I want you to be by my side.
Please sing.
Is there a man in your life?
The population of this city is on the increase.
I don't feel at ease here.
I can't speak English at all.
I see your cat in the garden.
Which are the best ones?
Don't release that dog.
I'm tired of waiting.
The girl trembled with fear.
"Art is not a luxury, but a necessity."
You should have come a little earlier.
It's none of your business.
I needed money.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
Take one of these.
Stop being stupid.
Is there anything I should know about?
All of you look healthy.
There are about seven billion people in the world.
A light lunch will be served.
I am an American.
Those were his actual words.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
He was covered with bruises.
There's definitely something else.
I think it's time for me to contact her.
Just give me what I want.
If only I'd known then what I know now.
Didn't you wear that same shirt yesterday?
I still don't understand how this happened.
I never said I was an artist.
She married a musician.
Run for it!
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
Have you ever seen a monkey?
Please think about it.
Did Tom really win a lottery?
That work was done very quickly.
Tom made a list of songs he doesn't like.
Are you busy?
Tom is older than he looks.
Where is the most beautiful place in the world?
She needed the entire afternoon to complete the work.
She said she had been happy.
He looks strong.
You didn't get very far.
I can't deal with this problem anymore.
They began to quarrel among themselves.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
I sneeze a lot.
That makes perfect sense to me.
You were thirty minutes late.
He is better than me at math.
There are some books on the desk.
Are you doing what you think is right?
You have no messages.
You're not the only one.
He is suffering from a cold.
Variety is the spice of life.
There was no bathroom.
Recently we have had several disasters.
A man began to follow Tom.
I do not know any of them.
I understand how you felt.
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.
There are not enough chairs in the meeting room.
We promised to stand by him in case of trouble.
How did we get into this situation?
Rainy days make me depressed.
We often eat raw fish.
I haven't sold one of those in weeks.
It hadn't crossed my mind.
I can assure you that you are wrong.
How did you get into my house?
"He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't."
I intend to stay at a five-star hotel.
I know Tom doesn't speak French.
He gave the same answer as before.
He meets his girlfriend on Saturdays.
He drank three bottles of beer.
This pond doesn't go dry even in the summer.
Let me get you some ice.
I can't believe this has happened.
He likes soccer.
It happened so fast.
We need help.
He's a creationist.
Do you want to tell me what this is?
Tom is frustrated.
He went to the dentist.
I'm a lawyer.
I'll be as quick as I can.
This is the place I told Tom about.
I feel ready.
They tapped the terrorists' phone lines.
Tom promised he wouldn't do that anymore.
You know I can't wait for you if you're late.
Don't you think we should at least give Tom a call?
I don't have the energy.
Just do what you have to do.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I'll remember that.
What do you think happens then?
That would be a wise decision.
I just got there as fast as I could.
Which plan do you believe is better?
How can I get to the nearest post office?
Never tell a lie!
She is everything to him.
You should run for president.
I think Tom could learn a lot from you.
We discussed the problem all afternoon.
We've used almost all the money.
My hobby is collecting stamps.
It's your duty to finish the job.
Mary carries pepper spray in her purse.
I've figured out the puzzle.
Don't do anything until I come.
Check that.
Everyone is here.
There was a cottage on the side of the hill.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Are you relaxed?
Let's go to the flea market tomorrow.
You sound tired.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
"Since it was already late, I went to sleep."
I am going to America by plane.
Tom didn't know where to park his car.
What time did you arrive there?
I don't think I'll go today.
I should've expected it.
I never murdered anybody.
You shouldn't eat raw snails.
We kept our word.
I like to travel alone.
What're you writing?
Let's just say I'm here to stay.
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
How far is it from here to the station?
What medications are you taking?
Did you make this?
I was in London last month.
How long did I sleep?
You need a reality check.
I think I'm ready.
Can you see it?
Is it large enough?
That's not going to change.
Would you come here a moment?
Get me some water.
I have decided to carry on the work.
They got into the train.
Tom has never been to a circus.
That sounds a lot easier to do than it is.
I want to do this right.
The weather is bad.
You can stay as long as you like.
I don't have the money to buy a car.
How can I extract the audio from a video clip?
Years passed.
You're acting like a child.
I'm afraid I don't follow.
I'm certain.
You're very funny.
He painted the door over white.
"My father was, I think, a little drunk then."
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
The girls danced to music.
Keep reading.
I overslept so I was late to school.
People who talk about themselves all the time bore me.
How many siblings do you have?
Maybe it wasn't so obvious.
I was bored.
You're starting to annoy me.
I cried on his shoulder.
Please pass me the sugar.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
I'm not so convinced.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Do you smoke cigars?
Mary was wearing men's clothing.
I'll always remember your kindness.
I admit to being careless.
"A coke, please."
Why don't we do this later?
He seemed to know everything about me.
She couldn't afford it.
Do you want anything?
Tom wants to be famous.
How many times a minute does the average person blink?
You don't have to eat it.
He's my partner.
Don't kid yourself.
I wish I had wings to fly.
Don't panic!
I dislike living in such a noisy place.
He has a nice personality.
I knew it was just a misunderstanding.
He has a bicycle.
You're very good.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
Tom accepted the job.
The law is not always fair.
She had the kindness to help me.
Is there any butter in the refrigerator?
I've never seen anything like that.
No one said anything.
I hate this part of town.
Change is important.
Tom just turned thirty.
"You understand French, right?"
Is this Tom Jackson's office?
We must tell him about it.
I take a shower every morning.
It's a serious illness.
Stop hitting the cat!
Why are they protesting?
A good idea occurred to him.
Isn't it infuriating?
"I'm sorry, but I can't help you."
Do you believe in love at first sight?
The weather changed suddenly.
Could you check the tire pressure?
I'm homeschooled.
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
She knelt beside him and asked him what his name was.
No one seems to know the answer.
Tom doesn't like Mary.
We don't say that anymore.
That sound is annoying.
Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814.
Why don't you sing something for me?
Tom is your age.
Those are your options.
I'm pleased with their performance.
Can I tell you something about women?
How dangerous is the situation?
You don't belong here.
How long have you been dating?
I'm dancing.
You're not safe there.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
He gave me a vague answer.
I count on your help.
How did you get out of your room?
You're the only person that I can trust.
I am expecting some serious work from you.
We finally arrived at the lake.
I don't like this book.
I lost my way in the woods.
I want you back.
I don't want to get into trouble.
That's the only appliance that I have.
I'll be very happy if I can serve you.
Tom played golf last weekend.
I put on my shoes at once.
I think Tom works in this office.
Is French pronunciation difficult?
Tom introduced himself.
Let me hear from you very soon.
This works.
What would you like?
He whistled for his dog.
You're incredibly talented.
Why don't we just sit here and talk?
I'm from the city.
How many men named Tom do you know?
A dog has four legs.
He hurried up so that he wouldn't miss the train.
I was ashamed of what I had done to my benefactor.
Who did you write a letter to?
Nowadays nobody believes in ghosts.
It is Tom's ambition to go to the moon.
I'll sign it.
Avoid it at all cost.
No one asked you.
I got fined.
I wanted to get my mind off work.
He cussed me out for having lied to him.
I think that I'm not academically oriented.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
I'm not eating this.
I could barely walk at that time.
The road was obstructed by fallen trees.
Coal and natural gas are natural fuels.
You know what they say.
Allied forces were attacking from the west.
She and her friends love music.
The man you met at the station is my father.
Is it a deal?
Stay a while.
Does that seem strange to you?
She hasn't cleaned her room yet.
Let's go back before it begins to rain.
I want you back.
I want to live in a castle.
Are you going to come back?
Did you enjoy reading that book?
It is under the chair.
What do you think about this plan?
The result was disappointing.
Tom wanted to be a better teacher.
Can you take this call for me?
"To tell you the truth, I'm completely bored."
I'm afraid of the same thing.
He received me cordially.
We'll only wait three more hours.
I got arrested.
He was born in Athens in 1956.
Tom thanked everyone for waiting.
Who's on the team?
How much does this umbrella cost?
That's an incredible story.
She gave him a massage.
Does anyone care?
"I don't have money, but I have dreams."
I like English.
I saw him with my own eyes.
I want to talk to your manager.
She was very rude to him.
Do you keep a dream diary?
That book is written in French.
We went camping in August.
All of us were shocked by the news.
Are you done washing your hands?
That noise woke me up.
There's nothing like a good hot bath.
You can do it if you put your mind to it.
He asked his friends for help.
Please sit still.
Today is tomorrow's yesterday.
I felt like going out for a walk.
Can you help us?
I think you'd better come back home.
I don't understand this obsession of yours.
Tom encouraged Mary.
You'd better hurry.
Don't swear in public.
Don't respond to that.
I couldn't bring myself to take the job.
You look fabulous.
She is a beginner.
He has a big truck.
That's my umbrella.
He's my new friend.
He has gone to Hokkaido.
I'm very much in favor of this.
She is holding her baby in her arms.
"I can't turn it on, because the switch is broken."

Were you able to solve the problem?

Tom is my brother.
He is tired from overwork.
The car ran into a tree.
I am wondering if I could be of any service to you.
Tom is leaving.
No criminal charges were filed.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
I don't like it.
Can you walk on stilts?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
My mother makes cakes.
I'll have to catch the 8:15 train to Paris.
Have you seen Tom lately?
May I put it down here?
What do I have to be afraid of?
She looked at him with a smile on her face.
Why did you join the Army?
I'm going to buy you a watch.
Tom doesn't want any part of this.
Our company's showroom was a hit with the ladies.
Did he show you the picture?
He needs to answer the question.
I want to be an astronaut.
I solved the problem a few days ago.
I feel like going out.
I hardly know anything about you.
He's a great kisser.
We need to be more aggressive.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
A stay of execution was ordered at the eleventh hour.
It's a matter of life and death.
I'm clean.
One cannot embrace the unembraceable.
She'll spend the next four years in prison.
You have to hold back.
Children should obey their parents.
"Where are the toilets, please?"
"Paris, which is on the Seine, is a beautiful city."
I want to get there early so we can get good seats.
There are plenty of oranges on the tree.
You're back again.
Don't make me go back there.
The Titanic hit an iceberg.
The leaves fell.
She spread a beautiful cloth on a table.
I was tired from doing my homework.
I thought you'd got lost.
"At that time, Tom wasn't very happy."
Prices are lower in Boston.
That's all Tom did.
"You like him, don't you?"
He lives off the grid.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
You get out only what you put in.
"Tom, what happened? Why are you crying?"
I don't know what we're talking about.
Who is the gentleman he is speaking to?
What causes that?
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
"Frankly, I'm not that impressed with his idea."
We talked about various topics.
Tom's behavior infuriated me.
Please be polite.
No one encouraged her.
It will be some time before he gets well.
I was born the year the war ended.
Take things as they are.
She is proud of her daughter.
I just love beautiful women.
I've only seen it once.
I'm deeply offended by this.
I love jokes.
He kept talking.
I'm learning French.
Can you deliver this?
What else would you advise?
You should tell the truth.
We're not friends.
He took out his handkerchief.
I seem to have the wrong number.
I've been working here for many years.
We're careful.
You are welcome here.
None of them know French.
What's your opinion on this?
I think that she's honest.
I found my bicycle gone.
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
He winced as the nurse pushed the needle into his arm.
Thanks for bringing me here.
I like traveling by train.
Enjoy your stay.
I never could hide anything from you.
What do you think is going to happen?
You may use my new car.
"We don't want that, do we?"
The robot went out of control.
I didn't sleep well.
I'll go wherever you want me to go.
Your team is stronger than ours.
I'd say you did well.
Who's Tom?
He's crazy about her.
I want something more.
You're considerate.
He looked like a rich man.
We have not yet succeeded.
What is this?
I know that.
I generally agree with her.
I think you should swim.
Yours was better.
You can't deny that.
I like being alone.
Tom looks disgusted.
It's a mistake that many people make.
I'm going to park the car.
Can you pronounce these words?
I got to the bus stop just after the bus had left.
I don't know where my keys are.
Explain that to me.
I looked up the words in my dictionary.
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
You're tough.
Tom is in a lot of trouble.
They're hiding in the woods.
I don't feel very well. I should go home.
Tom sealed the deal.
How can you be so callous?
Choose whichever you like.
They donated money to the Red Cross.
It just was not my day yesterday.
Tell me about your daily life.
My father is a doctor.
He lost all of his money.
The chair is far from the door.
"By the way, how many of you are keeping a diary?"
I managed to get in.
Where were you when I needed you?
I do the best I can.
They're all gone.
I think Tom wants Mary's job.
He treats me as if I were a stranger.
Eat your veggies.
You can't bury the truth.
I have very sensitive skin.
"You've got your permit, right?"
How's that again?
You're not very funny.
"On arriving home, I discovered the burglary."
He was sentenced to prison.
I don't want to fail my exams.
It's suicide.
You can't come tomorrow.
His girlfriend has lost weight.
Do you really mean it?
Where were you coming from?
She looked at me and laughed.
He sells fruit.
You have no choice.
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
You didn't need to tell me that.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
You're on the path of success.
You need to grow up.
I guess not.
I always drink a glass of milk before going to sleep.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
What happened here yesterday?
"Unfortunately, that rumor is true."
I don't see how that is any of your business.
I'm Tom's French teacher.
I can speak a little English.
"Coffee, please, with cream and sugar."
Grab him.
Do you want to do it again?
He can't count.
Don't just stand there.
Which book is yours?
I love to see you smile.
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
Is there some ketchup?
You're the sweetest.
What a funny man!
"In addition to that, he failed the examination."
Why are you flinching?
"Pass me the wine, please."
He will go to the meeting instead of me.
I will look after your cat while you are away.
I regret having done that.
Is there something you haven't told me?
Tom should've been an actor.
Are you sure that you want to quit your job?
A clear conscience is the best pillow.
What's Tom's address?
I have a lot of dreams.
You forgot to put on your tie.
You should prepare a room for the visitor.
Unexpected stuff happens all the time.
"Once bitten, twice shy."
I never meant to put you in any danger.
I am sure of his honesty.
We want to talk to Tom.
Can you think of a better way?
I knew they were your friends.
A smell of lilies filled the room.
The blouse is clean.
Are you losing your mind?
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
Doing it that way will take a long time.
It was one of the great discoveries in science.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.
My foot hurts.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
He failed to become a cabinet member at that time.
I don't see that as a problem.
Why do our schools look like prisons?
Nobody can solve this problem.
What do we do now?
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
"As for me, I have nothing to say."
There is a right time for everything.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
It's the size of a small car.
Why don't you tell me about it?
I don't like coffee.
Tom has a heavy German accent.
I want to stay with you.
They were afraid of you.
I'm glad to see you back.
He stuck his pencil behind his ear.
You could count to ten when you were two years old.
She didn't seem interested.
We must assume the worst.
Who would you like to speak to?
Many young people came to Moscow to study.
You're doing the right thing.
"Without water, nothing could live."
Be confident.
What makes you ask that?
I really like being with you.
Stop me if you can.
I can no longer find the Vivendi file.
He postponed leaving for Hokkaido until next month.
I have an audition today.
I received your note.
How much did you win?
She can sew very well.
You don't need to reinvent the wheel.
It needs to be perfectly symmetrical.
He has the habit of standing up when he is angry.
I'm sick of this hot weather.
I think Tom liked it.
I feel like an outsider.
I needed to be sure he'd come here.
When were you thinking of coming back to the States?
He is content with the simple life.
He is likely to be late for school.
Be punctual.
I hope you're well paid.
Does he go to school by bus?
Do you have any money?
I really don't want to live here.
Tom never got better.
"Get up, everybody."
I need a new bicycle.
"I don't know when, but it'll happen someday."
I'll go anywhere you want.
He combined two ideas into one.
I called the police.
Never mind what she says.
I don't want you to go home.
Did you listen to music last night?
Don't tell your mother.
They don't despise you.
Did you tape that concert?
We're nearly finished.
He caught her by the arm.
They weren't at home yesterday.
I know they'll all want to help you.
We can try it.
He stood with his back to the wall.
Tom would've been very proud of you.
You can go there.
"When we arrived, the lecture had already begun."
I guess this wasn't easy for you.
Bigger is not always better.
I want my room painted white.
I couldn't understand his joke.
They got the prize.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
Where is Tom buried?
Am I wrong?
This is ours.
I didn't ask for this.
Where are your credit cards?
Tom thinks Mary will be upset.
He's not paying any attention to me.
I had no idea of what she intended to do.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
"If for some reason that happened, what would you do?"
That's all I have for you.
Don't I get a goodbye kiss?
I don't deny I made a mistake.
"When you're mad, count to ten before speaking."
Work is everything to me.
Tom got his car fixed.
I want to hear more about your trip.
Would you join me in a drink?
My friend studies Korean.
Don't you ever call Tom?
Don't treat me like a dog.
Would you mind carrying it up the stairs for me?
It's a no-brainer.
Tom had reasons to be angry.
I am counting on you to deliver the opening address.
I like blue.
This book is boring.
How do you even know that?
He stopped for a smoke.
Shouldn't you be studying?
Is there a woman in your life?
I didn't go.
What's wrong with being naked?
I had to see you.
The doctor told me to eat fewer high-calorie snacks.
He will come.
How about we go for a drink?
The army had plenty of weapons.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Is anyone absent today?
I want to live in either Boston or Chicago.
They were lucky.
This is today's newspaper.
He doesn't have enough experience.
Kobe is the city where I was born.
That was the hardest thing I ever did in my life.
I need it for the parking meter.
You're wrong in this case.
"Help me out, would you?"
How did you come to hear of it?
It's the best we have.
You're not sleeping enough.
I hurried and managed to catch the bus.
Take whatever you want.
Do you see a black horse?
He wants vengeance.
I love the songs sung by Kylie Minogue.
I find it strange that she hasn't arrived yet.
Did you make any new friends?
I read the article about you in yesterday's newspaper.
Would you mind if I came along?
She gave him the brush off.
The bottle smashed to pieces.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
Be kind to old people.
They elected her president.
They can't do that.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
Try it again.
What do you want for your birthday?
We'd make a perfect team.
Dogs often bury bones.
I almost believe you.
They did the right thing.
Mathematics is not just the memorization of formulas.
All of us are getting older.
I got five hours sleep last night.
I am a teacher.
Don't make a sound.
I think that's horrible.
Some of them are teachers.
I feel sorry for her.
My favourite game is football.
Should we be worried?
I love what I do.
He walks fast.
Do you mind my making a suggestion?
I want to hear all about your trip.
There's nothing more I can tell you.
Thanks for the pizza.
I don't have that kind of time.
Am I on the right road?
How did they do that?
Countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
I was daydreaming.
Do you write short stories?
He always mistakes me for my sister.
She lived with him all her life.
I didn't think it was a problem.
Who cares about me?
Please give me a hand.
He's three years older than she is.
That's stupid.
Our club will hold its monthly meeting next Wednesday.
Reading is to the mind what food is to the body.
I really want to kiss you.
What if somebody sees you?
Everything is now back to normal.
Someone took my stuff.
It is worthwhile to read this book.
I'll drive.
I've lost my filling.
Tom worked until 2:30.
It may freeze next week.
Your phone is ringing again.
A new oil tanker was launched.
No one could solve the puzzle.
He is at the head of the class.
Do you know how to get to our place?
She bought a new house the other day.
Tom doesn't need to apologize. He did nothing wrong.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
I am going to get dressed.
He is still sitting on the bench.
It was really cold.
I never expected that to happen.
See you all tomorrow.
This dress would look good on you.
Australia is abundant in minerals.
What do you plan on doing tonight?
Disconnect the plug.
Did you turn off the gas?
"Obviously, you volunteered."
I'd like to apply for a visa.
That isn't Tom's suitcase.
I managed to make him understand it.
Are we all here?
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
I wonder if anybody can help us.
I can prove it to you.
Tom disappeared three days ago.
There are huge snakes on this island.
Listen to your mother.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Don't lose hope.
Tom stayed calm.
Tom opened the trunk of the car.
I'm fairly certain that's what's going to happen.
Tom left his dog at home.
Many people are on vacation.
Why don't you sing?
I'm afraid something is wrong with my watch.
Looters stole ancient artifacts from the tomb.
He helped me carry the baggage.
We've lost three games in a row.
Tom says he doesn't have any regrets.
A careful reader would have noticed the mistake.
She brushed away the dust.
Words can't describe it.
I forgave you a long time ago.
You look so beautiful.
I will help.
"If you take this medicine, you'll feel better."
I've had enough.
Nothing's gonna change my world.
I think he needs to go there.
You seem very nervous this morning.
"If you need my advice, I'd be glad to give it to you."
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Air is invisible.
That part is good.
Tom said my plan wouldn't work.
No one uses that word anymore.
I suggest you leave.
He didn't know what to do next.
He laid his head on the pillow.
It's only getting bigger.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
How much is it?
I have been living in Rio de Janeiro for four years.
I thought Tom said it was a dog.
You got shot in the leg.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary.
He is proud of being a musician.
A fire broke out in the neighborhood yesterday.
I'm only doing what needs to be done.
Put the following sentences into Japanese.
He has many history books.
She ignored him almost all day.
Tom likes to play tennis.
I am glad to help you.
The matter is all settled.
I thought it was stupid.
Let me see that.
You're the only one I think about.
She mixed him up with someone else.
Tom was cheerful.
Your questions were too direct.
We finally did it.
Somebody's taken Tom's place.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
"I asked Tom if he would go, too."
Three more passengers got on the bus.
I want to sit down.
What did you answer?
She divorced her husband.
I have already read the book.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
Could we get a bottle of your best champagne?
She decided not to go.
Do you study every day?
You don't have to come.
You're in serious danger.
We did it yesterday.
Did you ask the price?
My heart was in my throat.
You're just the man I want to see.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
What did you want to talk to me about?
How can you be so callous?
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
I've been dying to see you.
She advised him to talk about his life in America.
"Tom, are you awake?"
A baby is sleeping in the cradle.
I can't put up with that loud noise.
She spends time with her grandmother every Sunday.
Maybe Tom was the one who stole Mary's necklace.
He never saw his sister again.
You're a wonderful friend.
Business is so slow these days.
Tom wishes to become a doctor.
"If I were you, I would follow his advice."
You're very direct.
I can't carry a tune.
I'll be at home in the morning.
We spent too much for Christmas presents this year.
I believe that we found the problem.
Tom reminds me of a boy I used to know.
Beethoven was a great musician.
None of that actually happened.
He seems to be honest.
I can't really describe it.
I went into details.
Swimming is easy.
I'm aware of all that.
I'm not comfortable with this.
An elephant is a strong animal.
Tom will bat third.
I just can't wait to do that.
Is it something you can get rid of?
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
Dad knows what he's doing.
Will you give it to me?
My father must do the work.
We have a lot to talk about.
She asked him for some money to buy a new dress.
I had never seen a giraffe till I visited the zoo.
Practice what you preach.
"""Can I use your car?"" ""Sure. Go ahead."""
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
When is your school festival?
I'm more than just a pretty face.
Wisdom comes with age.
They do that sometimes.
What's your favorite sport?
We study the past for the sake of the future.
Meet me at the hotel bar.
What would you like?
Winter has gone. Spring has come.
He came downstairs.
We have to memorize this poem by the next class.
Try it once again.
Maybe you're right.
We're too vulnerable.
What are you reading?
The accident happened the day before yesterday.
Have you already eaten?
What does that even mean?
I'd like to keep expenses down.
"I'm happy, too."
He decided to seek information elsewhere.
She advised him not to borrow money from his friends.
What's that stain?
I just feel a little dizzy.
When did you notice that?
Help Tom.
He betrayed you.
Body temperature is highest in the afternoon.
I don't know what I want to do yet.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
Tom won't let Mary do anything she wants to do.
I withdrew some money from the bank for my trip.
That would be a waste of her talent.
This stone was too heavy for me to lift.
It is said that he is the richest man in the world.
"Give me a coffee, please."
These are probably yours.
I can't stay here any longer.
Have you brought your ID card with you?
It was lucky for you that you found it.
His business has gone from bad to worse.
"If I had known it, I would have told you."
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
There are no coincidences.
The university bears the name of its founder.
Tom hasn't eaten anything in the past 36 hours.
He was standing there with a vacant look.
I just received your letter.
She risked her life to protect her child.
The new government has financial troubles.
I'll get you some brandy.
Please pull the rope.
Do you speak French well?
Why are you all here?
Tom asked me how many guitars I own.
I've seen this before.
I'm still not sure.
The airport was closed because of the fog.
I'm just lazy.
You seem busy.
What a beautiful rainbow!
"She visits him quite often, but never stays very long."
It was a hoax.
Give Tom a second chance.
Please hand this in at the front desk.
A plane is flying above the city.
Her fears gradually quietened down.
I confessed.
The situation is growing serious.
She's lost her car keys.
Tom is older than your father.
Tom didn't know Mary.
The students burned their textbooks.
Is that why you want to hurt me?
This can't be what it looks like.
I like that.
Our allies are weak.
Can you watch the kids?
That's a fake.
I didn't get any of that.
I got bored with his long talk.
It was yesterday that he died.
The doctor advised him not to smoke.
This elevator is out of order. Please use the stairs.
Could you speak as slowly as possible?
Why am I doing this?
The steak is well done.
Did you go out?
Their concert was a big hit.
What floor do you live on?
Lots of famous people come here.
Grab my hand.
You won't believe your eyes.
I promise I'll bring it right back.
I'll send someone up to help you now.
You won't have to take charge of that.
Some flowers bloom in spring and others in autumn.
I just want you to listen.
That's what you always do.
I can't save you this time.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
This guy is a loser.
I will come with you.
Why are you running?
What do your parents want for Christmas?
"Tom has a plan, right?"
I think we should sit down.
Everybody's safe.
She would often play tricks on me.
I had no idea you were so young.
"When I grow up, I want to be an English teacher."
I met a friend of Mary's.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
How do you usually decide what to eat?
I keep a diary.
I'm glad you came over.
I thought I was alone here.
They walked down the street singing a song.
I would like you to understand.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
He decided to give up smoking once and for all.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Please turn off the light.
I feel his pain.
Are you on crack?
He can speak Russian as well.
Children can't drink wine.
I would like to work with your company.
I didn't spend anything.
The train arrived on time.
Let me deal with him.
He noticed straight away.
I wish I could fall asleep that quickly.
We want Tom to sing with us.
That would be quite acceptable.
This needs to change.
Don't touch the glass.
I'm sorry about your loss.
Don't you read the tabloids?
I do want to be your friend.
I think it's time for me to say what I really think.
"My wife used to stay home, but she works now."
Is this place far from the bank?
That hat becomes you.
My uncle lives near the school.
What's your dad's name?
They didn't choose me.
He's nothing more than a common thug.
Tom didn't know Mary was so funny.
I begin this afternoon.
We were all so busy then.
Her one wish was to see her son again.
I get it.
The event is on Monday.
I've had a busy week.
How thrilling!
Give me your telephone number.
There isn't any problem at all.
I want to find someplace quiet to study.
Help yourself to the strawberry jam.
This last week's been crazy.
"Against all expectations, we became good friends."
Don't be so reserved.
Lock your doors.
You're up to something.
Who volunteered?
What time's your flight?
What is the total amount of money you spent?
All that has changed now.
I'll come into the office early tomorrow.
Don't hesitate to tell me if you need anything.
We walked ten miles that day.
This place is really beautiful.
You'll soon be able to sing as well as Tom.
Which is your suitcase?
Don't knock it unless you try it first.
I never got caught.
My daughter is three years old.
Why don't you return to your quarters?
It was a nice party.
You're fine.
It only takes a few minutes.
Eating too much is bad for your health.
Are you talking to me?
How do you think it made me feel?
You're demented.
The door opened and a man came out.
He is all but dead.
Our teacher looks young for her age.
Tom didn't wear a suit.
It was all over.
I want to go over a few things with you.
We should sit down.
There's no food.
This book is available at one shop only.
Don't move.
I can't put up with the noise.
"I'd like three tickets, please."
This is how I made it.
I don't want to do that.
I apologize to all of you.
Tom wants to be a celebrity.
I returned the book to its shelf.
They know we're here.
That isn't enough.
That's very good advice.
I hope everything will turn out well in the end.
I'll fill you in later.
He has broad shoulders.
Take a breath.
Am I the only one that doesn't agree with you?
I'm ready if you are.
"Sorry, I am late."
We will make an exception of your case.
I don't have any ideas at this time.
I knew you were behind it.
He went to the store.
I'll never leave you alone again.
There is no factory in this village.
Let's get cracking!
Is that what you think I want to hear?
I just wanted to talk to you.
There used to be a church here.
She demanded to see the manager.
They say she is the kindest woman on earth.
I'm a bit tipsy.
They greeted each other warmly.
This is an important letter.
You're very clever.
What were you doing at that time?
You had better go to the dentist.
He went out the window.
He doesn't understand you.
I'm bored right now.
You need to be prepared.
Have you made any friends yet?
I've never been abroad.
We just can't stand each other.
Tom is slow.
I remember them.
Don't lose your purse.
I suppose you like him.
His record will never be broken.
When do you think he'll be back?
She left me a note.
I don't want to buy this kind of sofa.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
My advice is for you to go home.
I took sides with them in the argument.
I know who asked you here.
You'd better go.
I don't love her.
Go and sit by your father.
She married him last year.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I might say yes.
I love everything about Tom.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
When do you mean to start?
Mine is not so good as yours.
I don't know how they did it.
"If that's what you want to do, do it."
Are you through with your work?
Is that a picture of me?
Tears filled her eyes.
It's a risk we'll have to take.
I thought it over and decided not to go.
I'm not eating this fish.
Someone is knocking on the door.
What does this remind you of?
"At last, I passed the test."
Come and help us.
I'm afraid so.
Tom rinsed his mouth.
She must have been very beautiful.
It's obvious to everyone that he's a genius.
I did warn you.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
I think I'd like to marry her.
I like lots of butter on my toast in the morning.
Which student went out?
I know it's a lie.
It's there someone you can trust?
I had never seen so many squirrels in my life.
Who are you laughing at?
I think you did very well.
They couldn't find the problem.
Tom wants to apologize to you.
The ground seems wet.
It's my book.
You are hilarious.
I prefer French films to American ones.
What do you say we go there?
There were hundreds of birds on the lake.
I'm sad without you.
I thought you were older than me.
It's half past eight.
No security system is foolproof.
You know very well how it happened.
It is raining hard now.
Did you know him well?
I just want to let you know that I won't let you down.
Are we lost?
More than twenty boys went there.
He hurried to the station.
I'd like you to postpone your trip.
I like short hair.
That's a very good point.
They have plenty of money.
Is this place safe?
Why didn't you listen to him?
I was the only woman.
It's time to get up.
I am very happy with it.
She gave us a present.
I can't force you to do anything.
Can you persuade him to join our club?
This box is made of cardboard.
Oil is expensive.
This apple is bad.
I would like a word with you.
Who ordered that?
No medicine can cure this disease.
Do you mind if I take my shirt off?
Tom ran a half-marathon.
Who came?
I don't know where it came from.
Do you mind if I use your computer?
I thought we could talk.
I want you to do this right.
I'm going to fight.
I am through with my work.
You have gone too far.
We usually walk to school.
I asked my mother to wake me up at four.
We're eating apples.
I have something in my eye.
It couldn't have come at a worse time.
It was no use trying to take her to the hospital.
The letter will arrive tomorrow.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I wish I could stay longer.
Have you ever been run over?
Everybody's dead.
Do you remember your grandfather?
I have no intention of telling you the result.
This is appalling.
He often eats fish for dinner.
I just can't take it.
I'm glad you asked that question.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
You can't come tomorrow.
She reserved a room.
He is constantly complaining.
Tom still loves Mary.
I can't thank you enough for what you did for me.
It's said that he knows the secret.
May I call on you at your house tomorrow morning?
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
I have something that I want to say to him.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
I had never seen so much money.
He was involved in the trouble.
I'm sure we can work this out.
The kids are driving me crazy.
I know where we are.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
Tom says that he hates to study.
I'm not a gambler.
Who else do you know here?
Could you show me how to use this pump?
He put his tools away after he had finished.
I don't even want to think about what could happen.
I will be able to pass the test.
I wish Tom the best.
I hate it when my clothes smell of cigarette smoke.
What's up?
She has long hair.
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
"Between you and me, I don't like our new team captain."
I was given a medal.
Tom approves.
I feel like throwing up.
Do you speak French?
You don't even know how.
I really am very busy.
I suppose you like it.
I like writing with a fountain pen.
Tom is very greedy.
She is going to have a baby this month.
I'll stay here until ten.
Do you get it?
Ask him if he can speak Japanese.
I did that without consulting anyone.
Someone must have left the water running.
He would do whatever it takes to make money.
It is no use giving her advice.
You knew I was married.
Tom has nothing to lose.
He was stunned.
They trusted you.
The police caught the thief.
I'll definitely vote for Tom.
I like listening to Tom tell stories.
It must be really creepy to work in a morgue.
He didn't agree with us about the matter.
"If I pay you a dollar, we'll be even."
What are some foods you usually eat with chopsticks?
I smell gas.
"I'll see you later, OK?"
My kid was in the car.
We want peace in the world.
He is no fool.
"Eat your soup, please."
I shouldn't have done this.
Someone is lying.
Oh! That's too bad.
Take a look.
They all did it.
They trusted you.
You look tired.
The cap is too small for me.
I had issues I had to deal with.
I wonder if this really works.
I know that this is important to you.
He's intelligent.
Give me a little money.
I'd like to graduate next spring.
I looked at the calendar on the wall.
The girl who is dressed in white is my fiancée.
Would you be interested in having dinner with me?
This is an express train. It won't make many stops.
How much is this tie?
We're sorry we can't help you.
You can't stay in here all day.
We won.
Smell this flower.
I love seeing you so happy.
She had only a small sum of money.
I could hear everything.
She was too tired to keep on working.
The patient's in the hospital.
I didn't see you come in.
He wants to go out with her.
Tom lives all alone in the woods.
It's started.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
He promoted the idea of world government.
What kind of wine do you have?
Nothing was funny.
They knew how much danger they were in.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
It's a nice town.
Are you that stupid?
He unbuckled his belt.
Tell me why you think that.
The exam was very difficult.
They despise you.
He asked me what I had been doing.
Lay down on the couch.
Step aside.
This is pretty.
I'd like to take a short break.
She didn't want him to go overseas.
Are you going to be OK?
I love the way you walk.
I am free from care.
I don't know if I can do this.
He nodded to me as he passed.
You can't do both at the same time.
This room is very warm.
She advised him to go there alone.
"We're competitors, not partners."
We must speak.
Let's get back on topic.
Talk to me if you want.
Tom isn't going to listen.
What are you going to do this evening?
They'll be so happy to have Tom back.
I don't know how you do that.
You're disobeying orders.
Tom let us go.
I have something I want to say to you.
The plane arrived on time.
I think you sent me the wrong document.
Cows eat grass.
You're the teacher.
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
I can hear something.
Please pass me the butter.
You're very brave.
She is a very good teacher.
Are you happy with that?
We still have plenty of time left.
Tom didn't go to the dance.
I do that for the money.
There was only one small problem.
What are you going to do this evening?
I'm easygoing.
He will forever be in our hearts.
I'm just a plain old office worker.
I went to see a movie with Tom after school.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
It's because of you that I'm an invalid.
What's the text about?
You're too stupid to live.
"We hurried to the airport, but we missed the plane."
I played with Tom and Mary today.
Is that all right with you?
We can't trust anyone now.
Do you know who she is?
I can easily touch my toes.
New roads were constructed one after another.
Tom was bullied as a child.
That mountain is five times as high as this one.
I know what they're like.
We're half right.
You're going too fast.
Tom wasn't scared of the police.
Get in the car now.
Can I buy you another beer?
They guaranteed regular employment to their workers.
I'm beginning to smell a rat.
We'll help you.
It's in my jacket pocket.
Nobody knows about the plan.
I write almost every day.
I didn't have to go.
I go to school on foot.
He should have been an actor.
I wasn't sure about that.
My grandpa believes that the moon landing was a hoax.
He has a deep affection for his son.
I couldn't wait to get started.
She told him a joke.
She was equal to the job.
The telephone rang several times.
"I think so, too."
Why do you always do this?
You can't give me orders.
I can't put up with all that noise.
What's in the box is none of your business.
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
Is this the train for New York?
I gave a homeless man twenty dollars.
We volunteered.
I asked Tom for advice.
The hostages will be released tomorrow.
You're free to go.
I really have missed you.
It seems safe enough.
The snow was knee deep.
You don't know who I am.
How much is your hourly pay?
You need to sit down and rest.
I want soup.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
I'll help you after work if I'm not too tired.
His house is by a river.
They never found out the truth.
Keep this lesson in mind.
Spouses are also welcome.
We're not gonna make it.
When will we get there?
Are you kidding?
I don't know when my mother will come back.
I don't like hot tubs.
The bakery is located next to the butcher shop.
I have no intention of meddling in your affairs.
I don't care where you're eating dinner.
He asked a very good question.
He didn't carry out his promise.
I was feeling nervous.
What do you have to do?
I was supposed to leave yesterday.
Please be careful.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Hand in your papers.
I feel very betrayed.
I think you deserve this.
I think Tom didn't tell us everything.
We don't need these things.
I came home empty handed.
I haven't seen them in a long time.
She paid to attend the concert.
This is what'll happen.
It's way too cold to swim.
She lived all her life in that town.
Spring is coming.
You're beautiful.
She wrapped the present in paper.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
That's exactly what Tom said.
Will there be any permanent damage?
Tom left his umbrella in the classroom.
"If you want me to help you, all you have to do is ask."
I waited a whole year for that.
He's already a man.
You might get something in the mail today.
I have many coins in this box.
I need to stop.
I'll do all the talking.
He was very good at playing tennis.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
He hasn't written to them in a long time.
What do you think happens then?
I'm voting no.
Tom has nothing to do with it.
Why are they doing this?
It's the best thing I ever did.
He is not at all a gentleman.
He hit me by mistake.
Our car is equipped with air conditioning.
I've come to speak with you.
You don't seem tired at all.
Tom's proposal is worth considering.
I trust the room will be to your satisfaction.
I need all the luck I can get.
The doctor advised him to stop working too much.
You look nice with your hair short.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
"I was bored, so I wandered around town."
She gets hives when she eats eggs.
This is bad.
I came into a huge fortune.
"Man eats to live, he does not live to eat."
I hard-boiled an egg.
"If you are hungry, why don't you eat?"
Tom needs help now.
Almost no one believed her.
I stared at the ceiling.
I knew it would happen.
It was really funny.
Reflect on what you have done.
She moved out of her parents' house.
You're very helpful.
This is all your fault.
Thank you for your kind words.
Let's eat sushi.
I'm just not very busy.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
"From here on out, it's smooth sailing."
She looked worried about her school report.
She's strong-willed.
I wasn't fast enough.
You must control yourself.
Christmas is only a few days away.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I asked what Tom was reading.
The station is not far from here.
You're the leader.
My uncle died of cancer two years ago.
May I eat this?
There are ten people in this room.
Don't you want to go out?
I figured it out by myself.
Do you talk to your cats?
This book should help you a lot.
I have to take the chance.
I wrote that.
No attention was paid to his warning.
Why have you been avoiding me?
"Now that you have made your decision, you must act."
What have you come here for?
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
"Obviously, Tom didn't want to go."
"As soon as she opened the door, a cat ran out."
I bought a pair of scissors.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
I keep my word.
It's illegal to buy cocaine.
My aunt lives in a lonely house in the country.
May I borrow that book from you?
People were watching.
This is all our fault.
It's time for a break.
This is extremely important.
My internet connection is slow.
Tom should ask Mary how to do it.
I've got to head back to work.
There are several forms of government.
A boat suddenly appeared out of the mist.
She takes care of many elderly people.
You're funny.
We have to give them something.
This is awesome.
Who let you come in?
I don't like homework.
I looked in the window.
I am getting dressed.
"Tom, I'm happy for you."
"You don't have to eat with Tom, but I wish you would."
She is brushing her hair.
"Which do you usually drink, wine or beer?"
I think I've seen that guy somewhere before.
We're in pain.
I told myself to stay positive.
I just want to tell Tom before somebody else does.
I wanna go to Japan.
Don't be so childish.
Smoking is a bad habit.
I watched TV after I washed the dishes.
It is very hard to live up to your reputation.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
It's no problem.
The lake is big.
Could you pass the salt?
There is an urgent need for social change.
Why did you agree to help them?
The sun shines during the day.
I'm fat.
They're cute.
I'm not mistaken.
This will protect your skin.
He runs well for his age.
I went skiing a lot as a kid.
Can you give me your cell number?
I must study.
You've been selected.

I want you to let me go.
He painted the ceiling blue.
Smoke was rising from the chimney.

Can we hurry this up?
I think we can make it on time.
I wasn't informed of this.
Go away before they see you here.

I cut myself with a knife.
I don't understand it.
Don't let his snide remarks get the best of you.
You look familiar. Do I know you?

Carry this.

How could it be?
Perhaps I was wrong.

I'm very glad to see you.
When do you plan to start?
Do this work by tomorrow if possible.
Sit beside me.
Try to control yourself.

Have you been smoking?
You can't be sure of that.
"Great weather, isn't it?"
She demanded to see the manager.
I have to show you something.
Are you good at tennis?
"If you had a time machine, which year would you visit?"

Doing that would be stupid.
I forgive you.
What should I do to stop hiccoughs?
People don't smoke here.
Tom looked at it more closely.
Who's to say it's not what's supposed to happen?
Refreshments will be served afterwards.

Life is really tough sometimes.
I don't like to see food go to waste.
I was new.
Is there anything you want to add to what I just said?
He moved the desk to the right.
