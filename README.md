**Speech-to-Speech Language Translation**

This project is a speech-to-speech language translation application developed using the Seq2seq machine learning model in PyTorch. It is designed to accurately translate spoken language in real-time.

**Requirements**

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- SpeechRecognition
- PyAudio (for microphone input)

**How it works**

The application uses a deep learning model based on the Seq2seq architecture to translate spoken language. It first converts the spoken input into text using the SpeechRecognition library, and then translates the text into the desired language using the trained model. The translated text is then converted back into speech using the NLTK library.

**Running the application**

To run the application, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

Streamlit run app.py

This will start the application and prompt you to speak into your microphone. The application will then translate your spoken input and play the translated speech through your speakers.

**Future work**

There is a lot of potential for further development in the field of deep learning and natural language processing. I am excited to continue exploring these areas and to develop more innovative projects in the future.
